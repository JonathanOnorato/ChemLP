### Quick Scraping Advice

We recommend using the notebooks that we've provided here. Specifically, we recommend using the `WileyFullExtractor.ipynb` to extract
a metadata corpus, which can then be used to extract a fulltext corpus from Wiley's API. Feel free to use it in a different way, but 
we suggest you start there, because that's how we have intended this package's usage.
