       "{'sub-text': ['The first synthetic polymer to really seize the public\\'s consciousness -- the first one to change the course of world events -- was nylon. Not long after its discovery in the 1930s, it had supplanted silk as the material of choice for stockings, having transformed a luxury item into a widely available commodity. Nylon came just in time for the Second World War. Soon, parachutes, too, went from being made of silk to being fabricated from nylon.\\nThe development of nylon took place at Du Pont\\'s Experimental Research Station in Delaware. For much of the twentieth century, Du Pont and other large companies relied on the pursuit of basic science as an engine of future development. Knowledge was the infrastructure that made future products possible, and so scientists were asked to explore the unknown; the applications of this work would follow naturally.\\nWhen Wallace Carrothers of Du Pont developed nylon, he had been trying to explore some ideas proposed by Hermann Staudinger at ETH Zurich. These ideas, initially controversial, held that many materials around us, including things like cotton and spider silk, are made of small molecular units covalently bonded to each other. These little molecules, monomers, bind together to form immensely long chains. In so doing, the monomers lose their individual identities and simply become repeating units in a long chain. They come together to form polymers.\\nNylon, in particular, is an example of a polyamide. It is composed of very long chains that contain regularly repeating amide bonds, N-C=O. That\\'s the same motif found in proteins in biology, and it\\'s the same pattern found in spider\\'s silk, which is composed of protein.\\nConceptually, we are taught in biology class that proteins are made of amino acids. An amide bond (or peptide bond) occurs when the nitrogen of an amine is brought together with the carbon of a carboxylic acid. A molecule of water is lost, and the nitrogen takes the place of the oxygen on the carboxylic acid, forming an amide, instead. The loss of water leads to the term \"condensation reaction\" because early studies of these reactions led to water forming droplets on laboratory glassware as it bubbled out of the reaction. In practice, industrial nylon production is really no more complicated than that.\\nOf course, not just any old amide can become a protein. What makes amino acids special is the fact that they are difunctional. They contain not just one functional group (an amine, say, or a carboxylic acid), but two. So, when the amine group of an amino acid bonds with the carbonyl of a neighbour, the carboxyl group can bond to the amine of a different neighbour. It\\'s like it has two hands; it can hold onto a friend with each hand, and each of those friends can hold onto another, and so on, forming a chain.\\nThis functionality is a key part of how polymers can form. Because difunctional molecules can form bonds in two directions, a simple coupling reaction (an amine plus a carboxylic acid making an amide, two small molecules making another small molecule) becomes a polymerization (many small molecules forming an enormous molecule).\\nWell, nylon isn\\'t made from an amino acid, although the coupling reaction is similar. Instead, it is made from two different molecules, both of which are difunctional: a diamine and a dicarboxylic acid. The diamine bonds to a neighbouring carbonyl through each end and the dicarboxylic acid bonds to a neighbouring amine through each end. For the most common material, each of the two reactants is six carbons long, giving rise to the term \"nylon 66\".\\nNylon 66 is an example of something called an alternating co-polymer. It isn\\'t just one unit repeating over and over along a chain, but two. The two monomers make the polymer together. We sometimes say that the monomers are enchained when they become part of a polymer. And of course, they have to alternate along the chain, so that one can bind to the complementary other.\\nIn the drawings above, the dashed lines are meant to suggest continuity: the pattern shown in the drawing keeps repeating to the right and to the left. More commonly, polymers are drawn using parenthetical notation. Below, the part shown in the parentheses is what keeps repeating. If we could make a stamp of that picture, we could construct the polymer chain by simply stamping that image over and over across a sheet of paper.',\n",
       "  'Carrothers\\' development of nylon at Du Pont led indirectly to a very similar polymer that was made in a very different way. Across the Atlantic Ocean, Paul Schlack at IG Farben in Germany was looking for a way to make a similar material that would not be subject to Du Pont\\'s patent. His efforts led to a material called perlon, sometimes referred to as nylon 6.\\nNylon 6 is not an alternating co-polymer like nylon 66. It\\'s just a polymer. And it isn\\'t made from a difunctional monomer like nylon 66 or proteins. Instead, it\\'s made from a cyclic amide, sometimes called a lactam. To polymerize, the lactam has to break open into a linear form, and the lactam monomers end up enchained head-to-tail. This process is called ring-opening polymerization.\\nThere are a number of things that are different about these two ways of making nylon. One of them turns on the whole concept of synthesis. Synthesis is the act of making things. It\\'s a little like cooking. You gather the ingredients. You take the right amount of this and the right amount of that. You mix them together and you get something wonderful. But that\\'s the difference here: in making nylon 66, Carrothers mixed two different compounds together. He poured one compound out of one bottle and another compound out of another bottle. He mixed them together and he got a polymer.\\nIn contrast, Schlack didn\\'t mix anything together, at least as far as we have seen so far. It all came out of one bottle. So why wasn\\'t it already nylon 6 in the bottle? If the monomers just react with themselves, couldn\\'t they have just gone ahead and done that in the bottle?\\nRing-opening polymerization, at least in this context, is an example of a chain reaction. Chain reactions don\\'t just happen by themselves; they need a jump start.\\nTo understand why, you have to appreciate that these two materials come about through two very different classes of polymerization reactions. Nylon 66 is the product of a condensation reaction. An amine is mixed with a carboxylic acid, water is released, and an amide bond is formed. Even if the pair of reactants is chosen to be more synthetically efficient -- say, an amine and an acid chloride instead of a carboxylic acid -- a condensation reaction still results, in this case releasing hydrogen chloride.\\nNylon 6, on the other hand, is not the product of a condensation reaction -- at least at first glance. Look carefully at the monomer and the polymer. Count the atoms. There\\'s nothing missing. No molecule of water or hydrogen chloride or anything else was released. The nitrogen at one end of the chain simply attaches to the carbonyl of the next.\\nBut if you walk down to the end of that chain, until you reach the very last carbonyl, what do you find there? There\\'s no nitrogen attached. That nitrogen was the nucleophile that bound to the carbonyl in the next monomer. There has to be something, though, because the carbon can\\'t be sitting there with only three bonds. So there must have been some nucleophile that added to that carbonyl, springing loose the amine that added to the next carbonyl, springing the next amine, and so on. There had to be an original nucleophile.\\nThis is the jump start that the chain reaction needed. A nucleophile had to be added to get things going. Once it reacted with the first monomer, the amine became the nucleophile for the next monomer, and that ring-opening produced another amine nucleophile, and so on. Because there is always a new nucleophile produced when the next ring opens, the reaction just keeps going. That first nucleophile, the one that got everything started, is called an initiator. The need for an initiator is a hallmark of chain reactions.\\nIn addition to the initiator, ring-opening polymerizations frequently employ catalysts to accelerate the reaction, just as in some condensation polymerizations. The catalyst may be a Lewis acid that activates the carbonyl or an \"organocatalyst\" that does the same thing via hydrogen bonding. Both catalytic approaches can also make use of nucleophilic catalysis. In that case, the nucleophilicity of the nucleophile may be enhanced, or else a temporary nucleophile may add to the carbonyl until it is replaced by the nucleophilic group resulting in enchainment.\\nOther polyamides can also be made by ring-opening cyclic amides. The same approach is also used to prepare polyesters from cyclic esters, also called lactones. In that case, the reaction is sometimes called ring-opening trans-esterification polymerization, or ROTEP for short.',\n",
       "  'Polyolefins are made from \"olefins\", which you may know as alkenes. Olefin is an older term for an alkene that is still commonly used in the industry.\\nThese compounds make up a significant fraction of commercially-used polymers today. If you think of the common recyclable plastics, polyethylene (#2 and #4, depending on how the material is made), poly(vinyl chloride) (#3), polypropylene (#5) and polystyrene (#6) are all examples of polyolefins.\\nPolyolefins have been known for some time, although it took about a century from the time that they were first documented until they were recognized as polymers. German chemists in the mid-1800s were aware that certain tree resins gave rise to hard materials over time, and these materials included polystyrene.\\nIf you compare the repeating structure of polystyrene to the structure of styrene, you can imagine that polystyrene is made from a series of styrene molecules that have been strung together. Essentially, the double bond of styrene has moved to attach to the next molecule, and the double bond there has done the same thing, and so on.\\nPolyolefins are formed in the same way from a wide variety of alkenes, leading to an array of different materials with properties that are suited to unique applications.\\nNote that, like ring-opening polymerization, olefin polymerization depends on molecules reacting with other molecules that are just like them. That isn\\'t likely to happen; they will need something to come along and induce reaction between them. Olefin polymerization is thus another case in which monomers are tied together through a chain reaction. The reaction will require an initiator to get things started. That initiator is likely to become an end group, hanging from one end of the polymer chain or the other.',\n",
       "  \"Polyolefins are usually made from olefins by tethering one alkene unit to the next, trading in a pi bond within a monomer for a single bond between two repeat units. However, there is another approach that converts cyclic alkenes into polymers. This approach is reminiscent of the ring-opening of cyclic esters and amides.\\nFor example, imagine a cyclopentene ring opening up at the double bond and reaching out to join with other rings on either side of it.\\nA series of cyclopentene rings that joined together in a row would look something like this:\\nWe would probably draw it in the usual zig-zag conformation.\\nThis act of taking a cyclic alkene, splitting open its double bond, and knitting it together with other such alkenes in a long chain is called ring-opening metathesis polymerization. Sometimes it is called ROMP for short. It has some things in common with other ring-opening polymerizations, such as ROTEP. In both ROTEP and ROMP, like molecules react together to form a polymer. In ROTEP, it would be two cyclic esters. In ROMP, it would be two cyclic alkenes. That was different from condensation polymerization, which required two complementary molecules, such as a difunctional amine and a difunctional acid chloride.\\nPartly as a consequence of like molecules reacting together, ROTEP and ROMP are both chain reactions. In order to get the molecules to react with themselves, they need an initiator. The initiator jump-starts the reaction.\\nOther olefin polymerizations followed this pattern as well. Alkenes don't normally react together (there are some circumstances when they will, but we needn't get into that now, as those events don't usually have anything to do with polymerization). Olefin polymerizations, in general, go through chain reactions that require an initiator to get started.\\nDespite these similarities, ROTEP and ROMP reactions are actually quite different in how they occur, as are regular olefin polymerizations, and the conditions required to initiate polymerization are unique to each case. ROMP requires something called an olefin metathesis catalyst. An olefin metathesis catalyst is a transition metal compound that is capable of splitting the double bond of an alkene in half and putting the two pieces together with other alkenes. The key part of an olefin metathesis catalyst is a metal-carbon double bond. That is the group that is capable of switching the ends of alkenes around with different partners.\",\n",
       "  'Polymers are long-chain molecules formed from individual molecular building blocks. Typically, the building blocks are organic molecules held together via covalent bonds. What other kinds of building blocks are available?\\nThe formation of coordination compounds is one of many important aspects of inorganic chemistry. In a coordination compound, an electron pair donor, called a ligand, shares its electron pair with a metal atom. Frequently, the metal atom is a transition metal, and very commonly it is a transition metal ion, but there are other examples as well.\\nFor example, the nitrogen in a pyridine ring has a lone pair. Pyridine can act as a ligand if its lone pair is shared with a metal center, such as the vanadium in trichloro(oxo)vanadium. The lone pair becomes a nitrogen-vanadium bond. Sometimes, this bond is drawn as a short arrow from the lone pair to the vanadium, emphasizing its origin, but more often it is simply drawn as a line, like any other bond.\\nOne of the interesting things about metal atoms is their capacity to form variable numbers of bonds. Although palladium dichloride could form a coordination complex by binding with one pyridine ligand, it can also do so with two pyridines. In the former case, it would form a three-coordinate complex, but the latter case would lead to a four-coordinate palladium compound.\\nRemember, the ability to bond with two neighbouring groups, rather than just one, is an important feature that can allow a small molecule to become enchained in a polymer. The palladium here is a link in a chain that is three units long. What if the ligand also had this capacity to bind to two things? What if, instead of pyridine, the ligand were 4,4\\'-bipyridine?\\nThat molecule could bind a palladium atom on either end. Once a bpy (that\\'s an abbreviation for bipyridine, pronounced \"bippy\") bound to a palladium atom, it would still have a second nitrogen lone pair that it could use to bind another. The palladium, too, would be free to bind a second bpy. As a result, these two monomeric units are able to form an alternating chain.\\nWhy would people want to do that? The general idea is to exploit the properties of these metal atoms in new ways. What are metals good at? They are good at conducting electricity, and sometimes they hold useful magnetic properties. If these properties can be incorporated into a material that is more like organic polymers, which tend to be inexpensive and very lightweight, then maybe they can be used to make materials that will have all sorts of applications in everyday life. Metals are also very good catalysts for a wide range of reactions. A coordination polymer serves to space metal atoms out evenly within a structure that has a lot of surface area, which could promote catalytic efficiency. All of these potential uses have driven a great deal of research into coordination polymers in recent years (as well as related \"metal-organic frameworks\").\\nNow, can all of the bonds along this metal-ligand chain really hold together to form a polymer? One key difference between the covalent bonds you have seen in organic polymers and the dative bonds here is that dative bonds are reversible. There is always an equilibrium between the metal-ligand complex and the free metal and ligand. Of course, this bond might be very strong, in which case the equilibrium lies toward the metal-ligand complex. In other words, a large fraction of the material would form the metal-ligand complex. How large a fraction? The real value isn\\'t that important at the moment. For our purposes, let\\'s just say we put a metal and a ligand together and 90% of the molecules form a complex. And suppose that\\'s also true in the next step, bringing another ligand into the picture to bind to the metal, and in the step after that, bringing another metal in to bind to the other end of one of the ligands, and so on. So, suppose each of these events leads to 90% product formation.\\nJust getting to that four-unit chain relies on three different equilibria. If, as we say, each step proceeds about 90% of the way (which sounds pretty good; you would be happy with a 90% yield on a reaction in the lab), then the entire three-step process would yield 0.90 x 0.90 x 0.90 = 0.73, or 73% product. Not bad. But useful polymer chains might be a thousand units long or more, in which case the amount of polymer actually formed of the proper chain length would be about (0.90)999 = 1.94 x 10-46 or 1.94 x 10-44 %, and that\\'s a ridiculously small amount.\\nNow, a real calculation of the equilibrium concentration is of course more sophisticated than that, but this quick exercise underscores an important point: in order to form a stable coordination polymer of an appreciable length, the metal must bind the ligand very tightly. For that reason, many approaches to coordination polymers have employed multidentate ligands, which of course bind more tightly than monodentate ligands. For example, the polymer formed using the bidentate binding shown below would be much more stable with respect to depolymerization (i.e. falling apart into monomers again) than the monodentate example shown earlier.',\n",
       "  \"So far, we have seen how covalent bonds can be used to bind monomers together into longer chains, forming polymers. There has also been a great deal of interest recently in using intermolecular attractions to make similar structures. Of course, intermolecular attractions are very important in forming large, organized structures in biology. Think about the twin helices held together in DNA, or the secondary and higher-order structures in proteins. Clearly, intermolecular attractions can be used to form large, stable structures.\\nIf the goal is to form a chain, analogous to the chains of monomers we have seen in other polymers, then it would be useful to have two sites within a monomer that can interact with other monomers. Such a molecule would be able to hold hands with two other partners, so to speak. If we take hydrogen bonding as an example of a strong intermolecular force, then we can look at a molecule such as ethylene glycol (also called 1,2-dihydroxyethane).\\nEthylene glycol looks kind of like ethanol (CH3CH2OH) with an extra OH group. A physical sample of ethylene glycol is a colorless liquid, just like ethanol, but there are noticeable differences between the two. The boiling point of ethylene glycol is around 198°C, which is over a hundred degrees higher than that of ethanol. Furthermore, ethanol isn't very viscous; it pours quite easily, but if you tried to stir or pour ethylene glycol you would notice that it seems much thicker. Something is holding those ethylene glycol molecules very tightly together. It isn't hard to imagine the formation of chain structures involving groups of these molecules.\\nIf we look at diols containing longer carbon chains, it's even easier to imagine something that looks kind of like a polymer, with monomers enchained together via hydrogen bonding interactions.\\nHydrogen bonds are strong, but they are still just intermolecular attractions, rather than true covalent bonds. They are readily reversible, so any chains that formed via interaction between these diols could depolymerize very easily. Individual diols could readily fall of the end of the chain, and diol chains could just as easily break somewhere in the middle.\\nWhat about a tetraol? If there were two hydroxy groups at either end of the chain, then the chain would be much less likely to come apart. Even if one hydrogen bond broke at one of the linkages, there would still be a second one holding two neighbors together. A molecule like that could form a much more stable supramolecular assembly.\\nThe dynamic nature of supramolecular assemblies is part of what makes them so interesting to researchers. Stable structures that can easily form under one set of circumstances, but gently come apart under another, could have lots of applications. For example, some researchers are interested in developing novel materials, such as liquid crystals, that might be converted from one form into another using different stimuli. Others are trying to develop materials that have useful medicinal and therapeutic applications.\",\n",
       "  \"The principle of functionality means that almost any type of organic reaction could potentially be used to make polymers. For instance, if a compound has two functional groups of the same kind, it could undergo reaction at two different sites, forming new bonds with two neighbors. The compound thereby becomes enchained in a trio of formerly independent molecules. If the neighboring molecules are also difunctional, then this pattern can repeat, forming a polymer.\\nTake the Diels Alder reaction as an illustrative example. On paper, the reaction is fairly straightforward, even if it isn't all that common. A molecule with a pair of conjugated alkenes, the diene, cyclizes with another alkene, the dienophile, to form a new six-membered ring, a cyclohexene.\\nThe diene needs two double bonds but the dienophile only needs one. Nevertheless, what happens if the dienophile has an extra double bond? The Diels Alder adduct that forms would end up with two double bonds: one formed from the original diene, as always, and the other leftover from the dienophile.\\nThe resulting compound is a difunctional alkene. Each end of this molecule could potentially undergo another Diels Alder reaction with an additional diene. Each time that reaction occurs, a new alkene is left behind where the diene used to be, preserving that difunctionality for another step. That difunctionality forms the basis for potential polymer chemistry.\\nIn fact, Diels Alder reactions have been exploited by researchers in a number of ways to make materials with useful properties. The fact that six-membered rings are introduced along the backbone, rather than a chain of single bonds, means that these materials display varying levels of conformational rigidity, resulting in some unique properties.\",\n",
       "  'Polymers are very large molecules made from smaller ones. How those smaller units are arranged within the polymer is an issue we haven\\'t addressed very closely yet. Topology is the study of three-dimensional shapes and relationships, or of how individual parts are arranged within a whole. Let\\'s take a look at the topology of polymers.\\nAt the simplest level, we have been thinking of polymers as chains of monomers strung together like beads on a string. We even use the verb \"enchain\" to describe the act of taking a monomer and tying it into a larger polymer. The chain is the most basic of polymer structures. This topology is often referred to simply as a chain or, to underscore the structure, a linear polymer.\\nEven a simple chain, in this context, can have additional structural features worth considering. These features are connected to how a polymer chain grows up from individual monomers. If the polymer results from a chain reaction, typically used for the polymerization of alkenes, then the growing chain usually has two distinct ends. One end, sometimes called the tail, is the site of the first monomer to be incorporated into the polymer, as well as some remnant of the initiator to begin the polymerization process. The other end, sometimes called the head but more commonly just the growing end, is the active site, the place where new monomers are about to be enchained into the polymer.\\nThat\\'s what happens in most cases when the initiator is capable of reacting with one monomer and starting the chain reaction. However, sometimes initiators are difunctional. Difunctional initiators are capable of getting two monomers to start growing a polymer chain: one in each direction. In that case, the initiator fragment is left behind in the middle of this new growing chain, which grows outward from the middles. Both ends of the chain are growing ends. In this type of growth, the chain is referred to as \"telechelic\".\\nSometimes, polymer chains do not have simple, linear structures. Instead, their chains branch out here and there. This topology is called \"branched\". Instead of looking like a snake or a piece of spaghetti, this structure looks more like a length of seaweed. Branching is sometimes an artifact of how the polymer was made, and so sometimes the same monomers may lead to a more linear polymer or a more branched one. The prime example if polyethylene, which can form high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or low-density polyethylene (LDPE) depending on the conditions under which the ethylene is enchained.\\nIn a branched polymer, smaller chains grow out like limbs along a tree trunk or leaves along a stem. We can take that arrangement a step further into something that looks more like a net. In what we call a crosslinked structure, branches connect one main chain to the next, tying them together into one big piece. Sometimes, this type of structure is called a thermoset.\\nThe word \"thermoset\" is really a description of a physical property of a polymer, in contrast to \"thermoplastic\". A thermoplastic is a polymer that can be melted and reformed into new shapes after polymerization. In contrast, once a thermoset has been polymerized, it retains its shape even when heated; it doesn\\'t melt. These terms have connotations about the topology of the material, nonetheless.\\nThe reason thermoplastics can be melted and formed into new shapes is that they are made of separate molecules. The molecules may be very long, and they may even be branched, but at high enough temperatures these molecules can move completely independently of each other. They can melt and so the material that is comprised of these separate molecules take on new shapes.\\nIn a thermoset, crosslinks connect the different chains in the material, forming bridges that span from chain to chain to chain, essentially uniting the material into one big molecule. If it is one big molecule, the chains can never move completely independently of each other, and the material can\\'t form a new shape. Looked at in another way, those crosslinks tie the main chains in place. They may be able to move around some, but they can never get very far. If the amount of crosslinking is sufficient, they will always hold the material in the same basic shape.\\nOf course, just a little bit of crosslinking may not have the same effect. You may have two or three chains tied together to form one big molecule, but they behave more like highly branched chains than like extended nets.\\nIt\\'s also worth noting that the term \"crosslink\" can actually mean different things when used in different ways. Sometimes, crosslinks refer to true covalent bonds connecting two chains together. These connections are called \"chemical crosslinks\"; the word chemical refers to the covalent bonds. Alternatively, chains can be connected to each other through strong intermolecular forces. That\\'s not at all the same thing, of course, because these intermolecular forces can be overcome with sufficient energy, and so at some point, the chains may no longer be tied together. These connections are called \"physical crosslinks\" to distinguish them from permanent bonds.\\nTo use a biology analogy, sulfide bonds in proteins would be an example of chemical crosslinks; they hold the protein firmly in one shape, and a chemical reaction is required to break that connection. The ordinary hydrogen bonds that are so prevalent in the protein are physical crosslinks. Because they can be overcome by adding heat, proteins are very sensitive to temperature.\\nDendrimers are another type of branched structure; the term comes from the Greek dendron or tree. Dendrimers differ from regular branched polymers in that they have a much more regular branching pattern. A dendrimer will actually grow outward from the center, branching out at regular intervals.\\nMany dendrimers are polyamides, although there are other types as well. Generally, at least one of the monomers is trifunctional, which introduces the branching in a predictable way.\\nAs dendrimers grow outward, layer by layer, they are often described in terms of generations. Suppose you start with a trifunctional monomer in the middle. That\\'s generation 0. If the monomer is polymerized outward until there is another set of trifunctional monomers attached on the edge, we have a first generation dendrimer. If we keep going and add another layer of trifunctional monomers, we have a second generation dendrimer, and so on.\\nThese dendrimers start to look circular on paper, like pancakes, but steric interactions between the groups forces things into three dimensions. As a result, dendrimers are roughly spherical in shape.\\nIn some of the examples of polymers we have seen, the chain is actually composed of two different monomers. That\\'s true in the case of polyamides such as nylon-6,6. In that example, the chain is composed of difunctional amines alternating with difunctional carboxyloids (such as carboxylic acids or acid chlorides). We can think of a polymer like that as being composed of two different monomers. Of course, because of their complementary reactivity they have to alternate: an amine and then a carboxyloid, to form an amide, and so on. We can think of these polymers as \"co-polymers\", meaning they are formed from more than one kind of monomer. We can go further and say that they are \"alternating co-polymers\" because the two different monomers alternate with each other along the chain.\\nIn some cases, there is no need for the two different monomers to alternate the way they do in nylon-6,6. If you take a mixture of alkenes that are capable of forming polymers and you polymerize them together, you may well get them randomly enchained into a growing polymer. This arrangement is called a \"random co-polymer\" or sometimes a \"statistical co-polymer\". For example, maybe you manage to get a random sequence of propene and vinyl chloride units along with the polymer.\\nNotice that in the above example we still have the same zig-zag main chain in the polymer; all that changes between one monomer and the other is the group attached to that main chain. It is sometimes useful to think about this main chain or \"backbone\" separately from the attached or \"pendant groups\". In this case, we have what looks like a polyethylene backbone with pendant chlorides or methyls randomly attached.\\nA random arrangement isn\\'t the only possibility. Maybe all of the vinyl chlorides polymerized in a row, and then all of the propenes were incorporated after them. The result would be a diblock co-polymer; there is a solid block of poly(vinyl chloride) at one end of the chain and a solid block of polypropylene at the other end.\\nThere are a couple of ways that could happen. Maybe you waited until all of the vinyl chlorides were enchained before adding any propene so that all of the vinyl chlorides were enchained at the tail end and the propenes were added at the growing end later. Alternatively, maybe you added them all at once but the vinyl chlorides just underwent polymerization a whole lot faster than the propenes; the vinyl chlorides all became enchained before the propenes had a chance.\\nThose possibilities assume that the monomers are all enchained linearly. There are other possibilities. Maybe one set of monomers form the polymer backbone and the other set form pendant branches along the chain. That arrangement is called a \"graft co-polymer\", as though we have little apple trees grafted onto the trunk of another breed.']}"
