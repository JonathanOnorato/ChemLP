polymer science as a part of organic chemistry goes back to the end of the nineteenth century when chemists detected that the properties of many substances with colloidal properties are connected with their molecular size", "as a result of these and preferably of his own studies hermann staudinger (1881-1965) concluded in the early 1920s that substances like natural rubber, cellulose, and proteins but also many synthetic resins obtained by so-called polyreactions consist of large molecules, for which staudinger proposed the term \u201cmacromolecules\u201d", "nowadays, macromolecules and polymers are synonyms for substances with espe- cially high molecular masses", "however a sharp boundary cannot be drawn between low-molecular-weight and macromolecular substances; rather there is a gradual transition between them", "one can say that macromolecules consist of a minimum of several hundred atoms", "accordingly, the lower limit for their molecular mass can be taken as around 103 g mol()1", " staudinger postulated that such macromolecules were built up from small so-called monomer units that were linked together by normal chemical binding forces and not by physical associations of small molecules", "this hypothesis was by no means self-evident at that time and therefore became an object of many academic controversies between chemists and physicists until about the late 1930s", "in the meantime staudinger\u2019s basic ideas of macromolecular chemistry are generally accepted", " in 1953 staudinger received the nobel prize in chemistry \u201cfor his discoveries in the field of macromolecular chemistry\u201d", "the scientific reputation of this new and rather young branch of chemistry is also confirmed by several other nobel prizes, so to paul j", "flory (in 1974) for his theoretical and experimental work in physical chemistry of macromolecules and to karl ziegler and giulio natta who in 1963 shared the nobel prize for their discoveries in the field of chemistry and technology of polymers", "more recently p.-g", "de gennes (1991, for discovering methods for order phenomena in liquid crystals and polymers); a.j", "heeger, a.g", "macdiarmid and h", "shirakawa (2000, for discovering and development of conducting polymers) and r.h", "grubbs, r.r", "schrock and y", "chauvin (2005, catalyst development, e.g", "for ring opening metathesis polymerization romp) were awarded", " d", "braun et al., polymer synthesis: theory and practice, doi 10.1007/978-3-642-28980-4_1, # springer-verlag berlin heidelberg 2013  1   2  1 introduction  fig", "1.1 macromolecular architectures  due to their high molecular masses, macromolecular substances (polymers) show particular properties not observed for any other class of materials", "in many cases, the chemical nature, the size, and the structure of these giant molecules result in excellent mechanical and technical properties", "they can display very long linear chains, but also cyclic, branched, crosslinked, hyperbranched, and dendritic architectures as well", "the thermoplastic behaviour or the possibility of crosslinking of polymeric molecules allow for convenient processing into manifold commodity products as plastics, synthetic rubber, films, fibres, and paints (fig", "1.1)", " man, however was by far not the first to recognize the tremendous potential of giant chain architectures: millions of years ago, nature developed macromolecules for many specific purposes", "cellulose, as example, is a substance which - due to its extraordinary stress-stability-guarantees the shape and stability of the thinnest blade of grass and the largest tree even in a gust or strong storm", " moreover,  transformation of small molecules into high-molecular-weight materials changes solubility dramatically", "nature takes advantage of this effect for storage of energy by converting sugar into starch or glycogen, for example", "also, thin polymeric fibres and films are widely used in nature: spiders apply them to catch insects, silkworms to build their cocoons, crustaceans form their outer shell of it, birds their feathers, and mammals their fur", "last but not least, nature

between two molecules, the constitution of the reaction product can be unequivocally deduced if the starting materials possess functional groups that react selectively under the chosen conditions", "if an organic compound contains one reactive group that can give rise to one linkage in the intended reaction, it is called monofunctional; for two, three, or more groups it is called bi-, tri-, or oligo- functional, respectively", "however, this statement concerning the functionality of a compound is only significant in relation to a specific reaction", "for example, the primary amino group is monofunctional with respect to the formation of an acid amide, but up to trifunctional when reacted with alkyl halides", "monounsaturated compounds, epoxides, and cyclic esters are monofunctional in their addition reactions with monofunctional compounds, but bifunctional in chain growth polymerizations", "molecules suitable for the formation of macromolecules must be at least bifunc- tional with respect to the desired polymerization; they are termed monomers", "linear macromolecules result from the coupling of bifunctional molecules with each other   4  1 introduction  or with other bifunctional molecules; in contrast, branched or crosslinked polymers are formed when tri- or poly-functional compounds are involved", " 1.1.2 oligomers  medium-size members of homologous polymeric

understood", " in dilute solution, the behavior of macromolecules is quite different to that of common low-molecular-weight molecules", "for example, the shape of a macromo- lecular coil is subject to permanent dynamic changes, and the coils are in a more or less swollen state when compared to their \u201cunperturbed\u201d (solid state) dimensions", "as a result, polymer solutions tend to be viscous even at low concentrations", "this again can have some influence on their reactivity (in macromolecular substitution reactions as well as during their chain growth), and change their physical properties to a certain extent", "however, the most fundamental difference between low- and high-molecular-weight materials is that polymeric substances are not composed of structurally and molecularly uniform molecules", "thus, even if they have an identi- cal analytical composition, the individual chain molecules differ in their structure, configuration, conformation, as well as in their molecular size", "hence, there is a mixture of molecules of different size, i.e., a molecular-weight distribution, and the compounds are called polydisperse", "as a consequence, it is evident that the expression \u201cidentical\u201d is not, in practice, applicable to the individual macro- molecules of a polymer sample", "it follows that most physical measurements on polymers only give average values", "the aforementioned peculiarities cause that methods suitable for the characterization of low-molecular-weight compounds are frequently not applicable - or applicable only in a substantially modified form - to polymers", "in many cases, moreover, completely new methods are required", "many of these methods require the polymers to be in the dissolved state", " as already mentioned, real chain molecules do not reach their ideal coil shape as would be expected by random-flight statistics", "this is because molecular parameters such as fixed bond angles and restricted rotation about the bonds affect the coil conformation as well as branches and incorporated rigid chain segments (aromatic rings, heterocyclic rings)", "also, the shape of the coil is determined by intermolecular or intramolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bridges or electrostatic forces", " in the case where macromolecules do not have strong interactions, neither with other macromolecules nor with solvent molecules, are build of simple linear nonbranched chains, and where the single bonds within the polymer main chain are sufficiently rotationally free, then the molecules assume - at least in highly diluted solution - a shape which resembles a coiled thread", "in order to describe this statistic coil it is common to use quantities such as the number of bonds in the chain, bond lengths, valence angles, and rotational angles", "the average conformation of the coil is then equivalent to the average overall shapes of the macromolecule which are randomly formed", "the fully stretched chain or the collapsed coil rarely occur", "loosely coiled species, on the other hand, are quite common", " the simplest theoretical chain model of a macromolecule assumes the polymer to be a linear chain composed of n + 1 chain atoms, connected by n bonds of identical length b", "the mathematically maximum possible chain length is l \u00bc nb", "  14  1 introduction  however, this length cannot be reached because of the valence angles at the chain atoms", "iupac designates the physically possible maximum length of a chain as the contour length, rcont", "for an all-trans

situation: dissolved polymer chains are much more probable in a randomly coiled chain conformation, and these conformations change perma- nently", "thus a polymer chain in solution is better characterized by its average end- to-end distance in the coil, or by its average radius of gyration", "these data give valuable information about the behavior of chain molecules in the respective solution: the end-to-end distance is the spatial distance between the end groups of a linear chain in its (randomly) coiled state", "the mean-square radius of gyration, <s2>, of a dissolved macromolecule is defined as the mass-average of ri 2 (ri being the distance of an entity of the chain from the coil\u2019s center of gravity) of all entities:  mi r2 i  ()  ()  ()  s2  mi  () ()

developed for random coils with only short- range interactions of the chain segments differ in the restrictions applied to the valence angles and torsion angles", "for very bulky substituents, the chains no longer form random coils but worm-like chains are obtained which can be characterized by the kuhn length, lk", "such chains are often called semiflexible", " end-to-end distances are parameters that are easy to calculate by theoretical approaches but cannot be measured directly", "on the other hand, the radius of gyration is a quantity readily accessible by experiment", "for m ! 1

solvation of the macromolecules is given", "here, the coils contain a considerable amount of trapped solvent and thus are drastically expanded in their dimensions with respect to the unperturbed coil", "the trapped solvent is in a state of continuous exchange (by diffusion) with the surrounding solvent, but it is nevertheless fixed to an extent that, in many situations, it may be regarded as moving with the coil as a whole", "the macromolecular coils are thus comparable with small swollen gel particles that, like a fully soaked sponge, consist of a framework (the coiled macromolecules) and the embedded solvent", "this concept is schematically illustrated in fig", "1.8", " with increasing concentration of the polymer solution, the coils take up a greater proportion of the total volume until finally, at a \u201ccritical\u201d concentration c*, there is mutual contact between the coils", "at still higher concentrations the coils interpene- trate or, if this is not possible on account of incompatibility effects, the interaction may be confined to the boundary regions", " depending on the molecular weight of the macromolecules and the quality of the solvent, the coil volume of macromolecules in solution may be 20-1,000 times larger than the chain volume itself", "thus, such a swollen gel particle may consist of more than 99% solvent", "since the diameter of such gel coils may be between ten and several hundred nanometers - again depending on the molecular weight and   16  1 introduction  solvent - these solutions may be classified as colloids", "however, in contrast to the colloidal particles of classic dispersions, the colloidal particles in macromolecular solutions are identical with the solvated macromolecular coils: they may therefore be termed \u201cmolecular colloids\u201d", " the properties of solutions of macromolecular substances depend on the solvent, the temperature, and the molecular weight of the chain molecules", "hence, the (average) molecular weight of polymers can be determined by measuring the solution properties such as the viscosity of dilute solutions", "however, prior to this, some details have to be known about the solubility of the polymer to be analyzed", "when the solubility of a polymer has to be determined, it is important to realize that macromolecules often show behavioral extremes; they may be either infinitely soluble in a solvent, completely insoluble, or only swellable to a well- defined extent", "saturated solutions in contact with a nonswollen solid phase, as is normally observed with low-molecular-weight compounds, do not occur in the case of polymeric materials", "the suitability of a solvent for a specific polymer, therefore, cannot be quantified in terms of a classic saturated solution", "it is much better expressed in terms of the amount of a precipitant that must be added to the polymer solution to initiate precipitation (cloud point)", "a more exact measure for the quality of a solvent is the second virial coefficient of the osmotic pressure determined for the corresponding solution, or the viscosity numbers in different solvents", " swelling in solvents is a typical feature of macromolecules that exceed a certain molecular weight", "one aspect of this is that macromolecular compounds can take up large amounts of solvent, forming a gel, with a marked increase of volume", "if this process does not lead to a homogeneous solution at the end, it is called \u201climited swelling\u201d; unlimited swelling, on the other hand, is synonymous with complete dissolution", "the extent of swelling depends on the chemical nature of the polymer, the molecular weight, the swelling medium, and the temperature", "for crosslinked polymers, which are of course insoluble, it is a measure of the degree of crosslinking", "although many thermodynamic theories for the description of polymer solutions are known, there is still no full understanding of these systems and quite often, one needs application of empirical rules and conclusions by analogy", "as a rough guide, some solvents and non-solvents are indicated in table 2.7 (sect", "2.3.1) for various polymers", "however, not all combinations of solvent and non-solvent lead to efficient purification of a polymer via dissolution and reprecipitation, and trial experiments are required therefore", " considering the rather complicated processes that take place during dissolution, it is not surprising that some systems show peculiar behavior", "for example, while solubility generally increases with temperature, there are also polymers that exhibit a negative temperature coefficient of solubility in certain solvents", "thus, poly (ethylene oxide), poly(n-isopropylacrylamide), or poly(methyl vinyl ether) dis- solve in water at room temperature but precipitate upon warming", "this behavior is found for all polymer-solvent systems showing a lower critical solution temper- ature (lcst)", "it can be explained by the temperature-dependent change of the structure of water clusters", "the lcst may be increased or lowered by adding special salts", "  1.3 states of order in polymers  17  surprising effects can also be observed when solvent mixtures are used to dissolve a polymer", "there are examples where mixtures of two non-solvents act as a solvent; vice versa, a mixture of two solvents may behave like a non-solvent", "for example, polyacrylonitrile is insoluble in both, nitromethane and water, but it dissolves in a mixture of the two solvents", "similar behavior can be observed for polystyrene/acetone/hexane and poly(vinyl chloride)/acetone/carbon disulfide", "examples of systems where the polymer dissolves in two pure solvents but not in their mixture are polyacrylonitrile/malonodinitrile/dimethylformamide and poly (vinyl acetate)/formamide/acetophenone", "these peculiarities are especially to be taken into account if one wants to adjust certain solution properties (e.g., for fractionation) by adding one solvent to another", " finally, we should mention the phenomenon of incompatibility of mixtures of polymer solutions", "it applies to nearly all combinations of polymer solutions: when the homogeneous solutions of two different polymers in the same solvent are mixed, phase separation occurs", "for example, 10% solutions of polystyrene and poly(vinyl acetate), each in benzene, form two separated phases upon mixing", "one phase contains mainly the first polymer, the other phase mainly the second polymer, but in both phases there is a certain amount of the other polymer present", "this limited compatibility of polymer mixtures can be explained thermodynami- cally and depends on various factors, such as the structure of the macromolecule, the molecular weight, the mixing ratio, the overall polymer concentration, and the temperature", " 1.3.1.2 polyelectrolytes electrolytes are compounds that break apart into positive and negative ions when dissolved in polar solvents like water", "sodium chloride, for example, splits into positive sodium ions and oppositely charged chloride ions when dissolved in water", "polyelectrolytes are polymers that do the same: they fall apart into charged polyions and many oppositely charged counterions", "then, all the charges attached to the polymer chain repel each other", "thus at low salt concentrations the polyelec- trolyte\u2019s random coils expand tremendously", "this is because the like charges on the polymer chain repel each other", "expansion allows these

segments cannot decide whether neighboring chain segments (which replace all the solvent molecules in the bulk phase) belong to its own chain or to another macromolecule (having an identical constitution, of course)", "therefore, here too, it assumes the unperturbed (y) dimensions", " another important aspect of polymer melts is that macromolecular substances do not change abruptly from the solid state into a low-viscous liquid; instead, the change proceeds over a finite temperature range", "this observation can be attributed to the fact that chain molecules undergo different types of motion, i.e., micro- and macro-brownian motions", "while in the former case only some chain segments carry out fluctuations and motions (the length of the moving segments depends on the respective temperature), in the latter case the whole macromolecule moves relative to the other macromolecules (reptation)", " far below the glass transition temperature (tg, see sect", "2.3.5.3) the macro- brownian motions are frozen in completely, and most of the micro-brownian motions are frozen in as well (\u201cglassy state\u201d)", "near tg, the micro-brownian motions set in and become stronger

the molecular weight, on the molecular weight distribution, and on branching", "so rheological measurements on polymer melts not only yield important information for polymer processing, but also allow deductions about the structure and size of macromolecules", " if a polymer melt is subjected to external forces (by kneading, rolling, or extrusion through narrow slits and nozzles), the entangled macromolecules are forced to give up their preferred (random-flight) conformation", "this situation might be frozen-in into the solid polymer by cooling down so rapidly that there is no time for relaxation of the macromolecules via dis-entanglement processes", "alternatively, the deformation caused by the temporary external forces disappears as soon as the forces are removed, in particular when the temperature is moderately above tg (above tm for crystalline polymers); in other words, even the non- crosslinked polymer behaves elastically", "however, this is not energy-elasticity (due to changes of bond angles and bond lengths) but so-called entropy elasticity", "it results from the fact that macromolecular coils insist on their statistically most probable conformation (unperturbed coils, random walk conformation)", "the elas- ticity of polymer melts is, of course, not ideal since the elastic recovery after deformation is not complete (\u201cresidual deformation\u201d, hysteresis)", "this is because the internal stress in the polymer sample related to the deformation of the polymer coils can be relieved also by migration of the macromolecules", "thereby, they reduce the restoring force to some extent", "this relaxation process occurs more quickly at higher temperatures since the increased macro-brownian motion favors migration", "in spite of this, a polymer melt is still elastic because of the efficient entanglement of the coiled macromolecules; the melt behaves in a viscoelastic way", "the rate of all these processes, of course, depends strongly on the temperature: in the vicinity of tg the polymer chains are still relatively inflexible", "thus deformation requires considerable forces, and recovery occurs very slowly", "well above tg the melt deforms more easily, but the tendency to flow as a result of increased macro- brownian motion is still outweighed by the elastic recovery", "the temperature range for pronounced elastic behavior of the polymer melt depends on the chain structure (e.g., whether it is branched) and in particular on the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of the polymer", " amorphous polymers whose

completely", "but even in crosslinked elastomers the recovery to the original state after extension is not ideal: in the stress-strain diagram, the stretching curve (extension at increasing force) does not coincide with the recovery curve (extension at decreasing force)", "there is thus a hysteresis loop whose width is a measure of the residual extension", " the properties of a rubber are determined essentially by the number of crosslinks (degree of crosslinking): assumed tg is sufficiently low, weakly crosslinked rubbers are highly elastic and have a low elastic modulus", "upon increasing the crosslinking density, the elasticity decreases and the elastic modulus rises", "highly crosslinked rubbers lose their elasticity almost completely (hard rubbers, ebonite)", " while elasticity of substances like steel or stones is determined by the tendency of the gibbs free energy dg (dg \u00bc dh - tds) to strive towards a minimum as a consequence of a decrease in enthalpy dh, the situation in the case of elastomers is governed by the increase in entropy ds", "this entropy elasticity provides an expla- nation of the fact that the tension of a rubber band (at constant

probable coil shape to the statistically less probable extended chain", "the higher the temperature, the greater the restoring force since the change of the gibbs free energy increases with both

the fringed micelle model (fig", "1.10), the macromolecules lie parallel to one another like elongated threads (extended chain crystals called crystallites), thereby providing the order required for

molecules", "as a result, macromolecular chains are formed", "they are, in general, linear, but can be branched, hyperbranched, or crosslinked as well", "however, depending on the number of different monomers and how they are connected, homo- or one of the various kinds of copolymers can result", "the chemical process of chain formation may be subdivided roughly into two classes, depending on whether it proceeds as a chain-growth or as a step-growth reaction", " 2.1.1 chain growth polymerizations  chain growth polymerizations (also called addition polymerizations) are characterized by the occurrence of activated species (initiators)/active centers", "they add one monomer molecule after the other in a way that at the terminus of each new species formed by a monomer addition step an activated center is created which again is able to add the next monomer molecule", "such species are formed from compounds which create radicals via homolytic bond scission, from metal complexes, or from ionic (or at least highly polarized) molecules in the initiating steps (2.1) and (2.2)", "from there the chain growth can start as a cascade reaction  d", "braun et al., polymer synthesis: theory

center is transferred to another molecule (solvent, initiator, monomer, ", "", ".) where it is able to initiate further chain growth", "the resulting \u201cdead\u201d polymer, on the other hand, can continue its growth only when activated in a subsequent transfer step", "because this re-activation in general does not occur at the terminal monomer unit but somewhere in the chain, branched or

may continue until, finally, the active center disappears in a termination step", " monomers appropriate for chain-growth polymerizations either contain double  or triple bonds or are cyclic, having a sufficiently high ring strain   2.1 methods for synthesis of polymers  depending on the nature of the active center, chain-growth reactions are subdivided into radicalic, ionic (anionic, cationic), or transition-metal mediated (coordinative, insertion) polymerizations", "accordingly, they can be induced by different initiators or catalysts", "whether a monomer polymerizes via any of these

effect", "monomers able to grow in chain-growth polymerizations are listed in table 2.2 of sect", "2.1.4", " 2.1.2 step growth polymerizations  in step growth reactions, on the other hand, neither are

active species (e.g., macro radicals or macro ions) can add further monomer molecules in the propagation process activation energy for chain initiation is higher than that for propagation monomer concentration decreases with reaction time  step growth reactions reaction often proceeds without the need for catalysts both monomer and polymer molecules with suitable functional end groups can react  activation energy is about the same for each reaction step monomer molecules disappear very quickly; more than 99% of monomer molecules have already reacted when the degree of polymerization is 10 monomer molecules first give oligomers; high polymer is formed only towards the end of the reaction the average molecular weight increases steadily with reaction time; long reaction times are usually necessary to produce high molecular weights  macromolecules are formed from the very beginning of the reaction  the average molecular weight of the poly-mer normally changes little with reaction time (exception: living polymerization)  evidently, monofunctional molecules cannot result in polymer chains via step growth polymerizations", "instead, each monomer molecule as well as all inter- mediates must possess two functional groups", "when more than two reactive groups are present in a monomer, branched or crosslinked products will result", "moreover, step growth polymerizations are categorized according to how the functional groups are assigned to the monomers", "when each monomer bears two identical functional units, the process is called aabb-type polycondensation/polyaddition", "here, mixtures of at least two different types of monomers are required, bearing the complementary functional groups (see eqs", "2.9 and 2.10)", "if, on the other hand, each monomer molecule bears the two complementary functional groups required for step growth polymerization, the process is called ab-type polycondensation/ polyaddition (see eqs", "2.11 and 2.12)", " \u00f02:11\u00fe  \u00f02:12\u00fe  as a consequence of the lack of special active centers, the chain formation in step growth polymerizations occurs via a sequence of accidental and independent reaction events", "it proceeds via dimers, short and longer oligomers until, finally, at conversions higher than 99% long chains are formed which are called condensation polymers (polycondensates) or addition polymers, respectively", "apart from high   2.2 techniques for manufacturing of polymers  37  degrees of conversion also a very precise 1:1 equivalence of the

processes can either be chemical or physical", "chemical modifications are reactions on macro- molecules without degradation of the main chain (macromolecular substitution routes, \u201cpolymer-analogous reactions\u201d) like, for example, hydrolysis, esterification, and etherification of side groups", "physical modifications include addition of stabilizers as well as the addition of (inorganic) reinforcing agents and also the mixing of different polymers (polymer blends)", " 2.1.4 polymer recipes reference list  the present book contains about 110 detailed polymer recipes", "yet, for quite a number of common polymers recipes are missing", "the following tables 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 attempt to fill this gap", "the information provided includes the name of the monomer, the formula of the basic unit of the polymer, and references for detailed recipes", "table 2.2 lists polymers prepared by chain growth polymeriza- tion, tables 2.3 and 2.4 those prepared by

in radical polymerization of styrene in bulk, polymers with the same molecular weight, but different distributions of molecular weight can be obtained solely by use of different reaction conditions", "this is noticeable in the rheological characteristics of the molten polymer (process- ability) and in some properties of the solid material", " the reaction kinetics of polyreactions have their own characteristics", "radical and ionic polymerizations proceed as chain reactions, whereby the stationary concentration of the active ends of the chain, i.e., of the growing macro radicals or macro ions, is very small", "in radical polymerizations, this concentration is about 10-8 mol/l", "for this reason, chain polymerizations are remarkably sensitive towards impurities that can react with radicals or ions", "reactions of such impurities with the growing ends of the chains can cause a deceleration or interruption of the polymer- ization or a decrease of the molecular weight by chain transfer", "a reaction with the initiator or catalyst can cause inhibition as well as acceleration (redox catalysis, co- catalysis)", "in addition, the steric arrangement of the monomers (cis-trans isomer- ism, tacticity) is strongly influenced by small amounts of certain substances", "in condensation polymerizations and stepwise addition polymerizations of bifunc- tional monomers, conversion rates of more than 99% must be reached in order to obtain high molecular weights; this is only possible when monofunctional compounds are largely excluded", "therefore, the requirements in purity of the   48  2 methods and techniques for synthesis, characterization, processing  monomers and auxiliary materials are very high", "in many cases, the tolerance limit for certain impurities is in the range of a few ppm", "methods for laboratory use which meet these requirements are described in sect", "2.2.5", " one more feature is that polymer melts as well as polymer solutions have a very high viscosity due to the size and shape of the macromolecules", "thus, in polymerizations in the melt or in homogeneous solution, the viscosity of the reaction mixture increases, often by many orders of magnitude", "beside an impairment of mass transfer, high viscosity also causes difficulties in pumping, stirring, and mixing", "in principle, the increase of the viscosity can be compensated by increasing the temperature, but this is strictly limited by the thermal stability of some polymers and, especially, by kinetic factors", "an increase of the temperature in particular causes a strong decrease in molecular mass and an increase in side reactions (chain transfer, crosslinking) in many polymerizations", "finally, the high viscosity of the reaction mixture also substantially hinders heat transfer", "due to the fact that nearly all chain growth polymerizations and step growth polymerizations are strongly exothermic, the rapid removal of large amounts of heat creates severe difficulties, especially if one works in bulk or solution", "furthermore, polymers are poor heat conductors, thus the heat transfer coefficient decreases with increasing concentration of polymer", "in addition, the heat transfer is reduced by the laminar boundary layer at the inner wall of the reactor, which is enlarged with increasing viscosity", "in this respect, polymerizations in dispersion are distinctly more favor- able because the reaction mixture retains a low viscosity and therefore turbulent stirring is possible and relatively high heat transfer coefficients can be reached", "if the polyreaction is performed in aqueous medium, the high specific heat capacity of water additionally contributes to the heat dissipation", "one more characteristic difference in comparison to the preparation of low-molecular-weight substances is the limitation in subsequent purification of the polymers", "thus, the complete removal of low-molecular-weight substances, such as solvents, oligomers, initiator residues, catalysts, and monomers can be very difficult", "because of this, purification is time- and cost-intensive in the laboratory and especially on an industrial scale", "special apparatus is often required (for laboratory techniques, see sect", "2.2.5)", "industrially, it is nearly impossible to separate the resulting polymer mixture into macromolecules of the same molecular size, structure, and composition, but for analytical use, some methods are available (see sect", "2.3.3.4)", " 2.2.2 polyreactions in bulk  polyreactions in bulk are carried out without solvents or diluents", "in this way, high molecular weights can be obtained frequently with high rates of reaction", "the resulting products are very pure, because only monomers and, if necessary, initiators and catalysts are added", "polyreactions in bulk are also advantageous for economical and ecological reasons because recycling and purification of solvents or dispersants as well as the disposal of liquid waste (as in the case of aqueous suspension or emulsion polymerizations) are not necessary", "on the other hand,   2.2 techniques for manufacturing of polymers  49  considerable difficulties in running the process are often caused by the removal of the heat of polymerization and the handling of the viscous reaction mixtures", "furthermore, polyreactions in highly viscous media show intensified side reactions such as chain transfer, thus influencing the properties of the resulting product", " polyreactions in bulk are divided into homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions, depending on whether the polymer remains dissolved in its monomer or not or, respectively, whether the polyreaction is performed above or below the softening temperature of the polymer", " 2.2.2.1 homogeneous polyreactions in bulk in homogeneous polyreactions in bulk, the polymer remains dissolved in the monomer", "in some cases, this can only be achieved by carrying out the polyreaction above the softening temperature of the polymer", "chain polymerizations, condensa- tion polymerizations, and stepwise addition polymerizations can be performed homogeneously in bulk", "the number of chain polymerizations that can be performed in a homogeneous phase is very limited", "on the one hand, only a few monomers are able to dissolve their own polymers (e.g., styrene and methyl methacrylate), on the other hand, temperatures above the softening point often cannot be used for kinetic and thermodynamic reasons (ceiling temperature, low molecular weights, increase of side reactions)", " in contrast, condensation polymerizations and stepwise addition polymerizations in the homogeneous phase are the most frequently performed processes on an industrial scale", "because the resulting polymers usually have high softening points and the fact that the molecular weight - and therefore the melt viscosity - increases with progressing reaction, temperatures of above 250()c are often necessary, at least at the end of the reaction", "even so, the removal of the highly volatile reaction products (water, alcohol), which is necessary in order to obtain high molecular masses, is difficult", "therefore, evacuation and intensive mixing, which create larger surfaces and short diffusion paths, are necessary", "similarly, the conditions for high conversion rates and the equivalency of end groups in condensation polymerization and stepwise addition polymerization must be adjusted by suitable technical measures", "moreover, high thermal stabilities of the starting materials and the resultant polymers are necessary on account of the long reaction times at high temperatures", "thus, many high-melting polyamides are not accessible by this process", "hence, they must be prepared in solution or by interfacial condensation polymerization", " 2.2.2.2 heterogeneous polyreactions in bulk in heterogeneous polymerizations in bulk, the formed polymer is insoluble in its monomer and the polyreaction is performed below the softening point of the polymer", "on an industrial scale, this type of process is especially utilized for chain polymerizations, for example, the radical polymerization of liquid vinyl chloride, the polymerization of liquid propylene with ziegler-natta or with metallocene catalysts, and the polymerization of molten trioxane", "  50  2 methods and techniques for synthesis, characterization, processing  besides in the liquid phase, some polyreactions are also performed in the solid state, for example, the polymerization of acrylamide or trioxane (see example 3.24)", "the so-called post condensation, for example, in the case of polyesters (see example 4.3), also proceeds in the solid phase", "finally, ring closure reactions on polymers with reactive heterocyclic rings in the main chain (e.g., polyimides, see example 4.20) are also performed in the solid state", " a third possible variation of heterogeneous polyreactions in bulk is the poly- merization in the gaseous phase or gas phase", "the term gaseous phase is used when the reaction is performed with gaseous monomers", "the polymerization itself does not occur in the gaseous phase, rather the gaseous monomer is adsorbed on the solid catalyst particles and polymerized in that state", "with proceeding polymerization, the catalyst particles are encapsulated by the solid polymer layer", "from there on, the monomer must diffuse from the gaseous phase through the polymer cover to the catalytically active centers", "the reaction medium is now a gas/solid dispersion of a solid polymer in its gaseous monomer", "heterogeneous bulk polymerizations often show deviations in their kinetics in comparison to polymerizations in a homoge- neous phase", "similar considerations hold true for processes on a technical scale due to lower viscosities and differences in material transport", " 2.2.3 polyreactions in solution  there are two different ways for carrying out polyreactions in a solvent", "when both the monomer and the resulting polymer are soluble in the solvent, one speaks of a homogeneous solution polymerization; on the other hand, if the polymer precipitates during the course of the reaction, it is called precipitation polymeriza- tion", "by addition of a solvent, different effects are obtained: basically, the viscosity of the reaction mixture is decreased in comparison to a bulk polyreaction; this facilitates heat transfer, mass transport, and handling", " in chain polymerizations, some additional aspects have to be considered", "for example, the undesired trommsdorff effect (gel effect, see sect", "3.1) in radical polymerization can be completely or partially prevented by choosing the appropri- ate concentration and solvent", "furthermore, if solvents with a high chain transfer constant are used, the solvent molecules can undergo transfer reactions with the growing macroradicals; this reduces the degree of polymerization", "in addition, terminal groups can be introduced which influence the thermal and chemical stability of the polymer", "in ionic polymerizations, the influence of the solvent on the course of the reaction is even more pronounced", "besides transfer reactions, reactions with the initiator or solvation of the growing macroion may also occur", "in certain cases, the solvent also influences the configurational sequence of the constitutional repeating units, as in the polymerization of dienes", "thus, the solvent for polymerization must be chosen very carefully and certain solvents must be avoided", "if there are no side reactions, the same kinetic rules as in homogeneous polymerization in bulk can be applied to homogeneous polymerization in solution", "on the other hand, if the polymer precipitates during the course of the reaction,   2.2 techniques for manufacturing of polymers  51  abnormal kinetics are observed", "this is because the typical chain termination via bimolecular reaction of macroradicals is hindered, whereas chain propagation is not affected", "the solid concentrations obtainable in polymerizations in solution are mostly below 20% and therefore distinctly lower in comparison to polymerizations in suspension or emulsion", " polycondensation and polyaddition reactions can also be conducted in solution", "condensation of diols with dicarboxylic acids in solution is advantageous for the preparation of polyesters that do not withstand the high temperatures necessary for melt polycondensations, or when molecular weights above 30,000 g/mol are required (see example 4.2)", "for this purpose, the polycondensation is carried out with an approximately 20% solution of reactants in an inert solvent", "especially preferred are hydrophobic solvents, such as toluene, xylene, or chlorobenzene, which not only form an azeotrope with the liberated water, but also prevent a back reaction by providing a protective solvation shell for the ester linkages already formed", "the low viscosity of the solution compared to that resulting from melt condensation allows the water formed to be removed much more easily; hence, solution condensation can be carried out at a relatively low temperature, controlled by the boiling point of the solvent", "however, in order to obtain a sufficiently high esterification rate, a catalyst, usually an acidic compound such as p-toluenesulfonic acid, is necessary", "if one of the starting components (diol or dicarboxylic acid) is insoluble in the desired solvent, it is possible first to carry out a pre-condensation in the melt at about 120-150()c and then to subject the resulting low-molecular-weight polyester to further condensation in solution", " condensation polymers, especially polyamides, can also be prepared in solution by the schotten-baumann reaction at low temperature (see example 4.11)", "for this purpose, two rapidly reacting monomers, for example, diamine and dicarboxylic acid dichloride, are mixed together with stirring in an inert solvent; the eliminated hydrogen chloride is trapped with an acid acceptor", " one usually works at room temperature in approximately 10% solution in toluene, methylene chloride, n-methylpyrrolidone (nmp), or dry tetrahydrofuran (thf)", "tertiary amines (triethylamine) or dispersed calcium hydroxide are added as acid acceptor", "this procedure has the following advantages: the polycondensa- tion is carried out at low temperature (0-40()c); it is nevertheless very fast, the reaction usually being complete after a few minutes", "at low temperatures practi- cally no side reactions occur", "disadvantages are the following: relatively large amounts of solvent must be purified and handled and large amounts of salts are formed as by-products", "condensation in solution at low temperature is, therefore, above all a laboratory method, in which these disadvantages are not so significant", "the schotten-baumann reaction between dicarboxylic acid dichlorides and diamines can be performed not only in organic solvents, but also, by means of a special experimental technique known as interfacial polycondensation (see examples 4.5 and 4.11)", "both variants have the advantage of short reaction times at low temperature with simple equipment", "  52  2 methods and techniques for synthesis, characterization, processing  2.2.4 polyreactions in dispersion  many polyreactions, especially chain polymerizations, can also be carried out under heterogeneous conditions", "in this case, the liquid monomer is dispersed by stirring to small droplets in a liquid in which it is insoluble, and polymerized in that state", "during the reaction, there is a change in the aggregation state of the dispersed phase, since the macromolecules formed are solids", "thus, the original liquid/liquid dispersion (emulsion) becomes a solid/liquid dispersion (suspension)", "if the poly- mer is insoluble in the monomer, e.g., polyacrylonitrile, this transition occurs early in the reaction; if, on the other hand, it is soluble in or swollen by the monomer, e.g., polystyrene, the state of the emulsion changes only at high conversion", "the term \u201csuspension polymerization\u201d was chosen with respect to the final state, while the term \u201cemulsion polymerization\u201d refers to the initial state of the system", "despite this formal similarity, the two processes differ in some essential respects, for example, in the size of the resulting polymer particles (0.1-0.5 mm in emulsion polymeriza- tion, 0.5 mm-2 mm in suspension polymerization) and in the reaction kinetics", "these methods offer the following advantages: the heat of polymerization is readily dissipated because of the segmentation of the monomer in small droplets and the high heat capacity of water", "the reaction mixture remains very mobile even at high conversion, because the viscosity is strongly increased only in the monomer/ polymer droplets, without larger changes in the overall viscosity", "therefore, solid contents of 50% are easy to handle", "polyreactions in dispersions can be conducted relatively simply in the laboratory", "in some cases, they are also used in poly- condensation and polyaddition reactions (e.g., interfacial polycondensation, see example 4.11)", " suspension and emulsion techniques provide additional means for modifying the  properties of the resulting polymers, for example: \u2022 variation of particle size and particle size distribution", " \u2022  this influences the rheology of the latex as well as the properties of the solid film (see example 3.46)", "incorporation of small amounts of ionic groups", "this has an influence on the pigment load capacity and on the stability of high solid-containing latices (see example 3.39)", " \u2022 preparation of polymer particles with core/shell-structure", " crosslinked rubbery polymers that are used as impact modifiers often do not have sufficient compatibility with the hard matrix of the surrounding thermo- plast", "one elegant method is to cover the rubbery modifier particle with a thin layer of a polymer that is compatible with both, the rubbery core and the thermo- plastic matrix", " 2.2.4.1 polyreactions in suspension in radical polymerizations in aqueous suspension, the liquid monomer, usually containing a dissolved water-insoluble initiator (e.g., dibenzoyl peroxide), is finely dispersed by vigorous stirring and polymerized at increased temperature", "polymer- ization takes place in the monomer droplets, and hence it follows the kinetic laws of   2.2 techniques for manufacturing of polymers  53  bulk polymerization", "normally, suspension aids (dispersants) must be added in order to facilitate the dispersion and, even more importantly, to prevent the coagu- lation of the polymer particles swollen by monomer in the later stage of polymeri- zation", "therefore, either water-soluble macromolecules (so-called protective colloids) or fine-grained and insoluble inorganic compounds, the so-called pickering emulsifiers (e.g., calcium carbonate) need to be added in amounts of 0.1-0.5%", "combinations of both types of dispersants are also used", "the volume ratio of monomer to water phase is mostly between 25:75 and 50:50", "if the size of the droplets is homogeneous, the ratio of 74:26 cannot be exceeded for steric reasons", "in order to obtain high conversion, initiators with different decay constants are used and the temperature is increased towards the end of the polymerization", " the polymer particles accumulating in suspension polymerization of liquid monomers show almost the same size as the original monomer droplets when no secondary aggregation occurs, as for example, with pvc", "when the resulting polymer is insoluble in the monomer, the polymer precipitates in the form of irregularly shaped particles, e.g., polyacrylonitrile", "on the other hand, if the poly- mer is soluble in the monomer, the polymer is produced in the form of regular beads, e.g., polystyrene", "this particular case of suspension polymerization is referred to as bead polymerization", "in many technical suspension polymerizations (for example, expandable polystyrene or pvc), one is interested in definite particle size distributions and particle morphology", "both are influenced in a complex way by many factors, for example, by the volume ratio of the phases monomer/water, the type and concentration of the dispersant, the geometry of the reactor, the shape of the stirrer, and the intensity of stirring", " on the industrial scale, suspension polymerizations are not only carried out in the aqueous phase, but also in aliphatic hydrocarbons using ziegler-natta catalysts, as for example, in the polymerization of ethylene and propylene (see also sect", "3.3.1)", " 2.2.4.2 polyreactions in emulsion working in emulsion is essentially limited to radical polymerization in water", "similar to suspension polymerization, the basic principle is to disperse a sparingly water-soluble monomer in water and bring about polymerization in this state", "there are, however, some essential differences between the two procedures: \u2022 at least a very low water solubility of the monomer is required", "extremely hydrophobic monomers, e.g., stearyl acrylate, do not polymerize under emulsion conditions", " \u2022 the emulsification of the monomer takes place in the presence of water-soluble emulsifiers that can form micelles", "at the beginning of the polymerization, the monomer

emulsifier", "emulsifier molecules consist of a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic moiety", "according to the electrical charge on the hydrophilic part, one distinguishes between anionic, cationic, and nonionic emulsifiers", "examples of anionic emulsifiers are the k, na, and nh4 salts of fatty acids, sodium dodecyl sulfate, as well as salts of alkyl-substituted benzene- or naphthalenesulfonic acids", "examples of cationic emulsifiers are quaternary ammo- nium salts that possess at least one hydrophobic substituent", "typical non-ionic emulsifiers are ethoxylated phenols and block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide", "in very dilute aqueous solution, emulsifiers behave as isolated molecules or as electrolytes", "with increasing emulsifier concentration, however, an abrupt change in some physical properties of the solution occurs, e.g., surface tension, viscosity, electrical conductance, and osmotic pressure", "the concentration at which these abrupt changes are observed, is called the critical micelle concen- tration (cmc)", "it has a characteristic value for each emulsifier", "below the critical micelle concentration, the emulsifier is dissolved as individual molecule, but above the cmc, the emulsifier molecules cluster to form ordered molecular aggregates, the so-called micelles, in which the hydrophobic residues are turned inwards and the hydrophilic residues are turned outwards towards the aqueous phase", "these micelles have a diameter of about 3.5 nm", " the size of the micelles is significantly increased by the addition of monomer up to a diameter of 4.5-5 nm", "however, the size of the monomer droplets is still very much larger than that of the micelles (diameters up to 1 mm)", "in emulsion polymer- ization, one generally uses

molecules that have already been formed (especially in polycondensations at high temperatures)", "these effects are often already detectable at very low oxygen con- centrations and it is therefore advisable to work under a nitrogen or argon atmosphere", " charging of reaction vessels with nitrogen should always be done by repeated evacuation and admission of nitrogen rather than by simply passing nitrogen through the vessel, since one can never be sure when all the air has been displaced", "the removal of oxygen in the vessels is easier if argon is used because the density of argon is higher than the density of air", "connections should be made with pvc tubing or glass tubing rather than long rubber tubing", " when conducting a reaction or distillation under a continuous flow of nitrogen or argon rather than in a closed system, a suitable outlet valve must be used in order to prevent back-diffusion of oxygen into the apparatus from the surrounding air", "in the simplest cases, it is sufficient to use a bunsen valve (a rubber tube with two lengthwise slits, closed at one end with a glass rod), or a paraffin oil valve", " if small volume experiments are carried out under exclusion of oxygen, an approved method is to use a balloon filled with inert gas attached to an otherwise closed apparatus", "likewise, using a balloon can easily compensate for changes in   58

with spontaneously inflammable substances (e.g., organometallic compounds) or with reactions on a larger scale, where there are rapid changes of pressure, it is advantageous to employ a backstop valve", " it is especially important to exclude oxygen and water in ionic polymerizations; the drying procedures normally used for preparative work are then generally inadequate", "glassware can be freed from water by drying in an oven at 150()c, but better by baking with a hot air ventilator under high vacuum", "gases can be dried by freezing out the moisture or by passage through columns filled with suitable solid reagents", "likewise, liquids can be dried by treatment with suitable drying agents at room temperature or by boiling under reflux or by azeotropic or extractive distillation", " agents for the drying of liquids must, of course, be chemically inert, as other- wise undesired side reactions could occur (e.g., styrene polymerizes explosively on contact with concentrated sulfuric acid at room temperature)", " suitable drying agents are, for example, calcium chloride, silica gel, molecular sieves, calcium hydride, or phosphorus pentoxide; however, their use must be adapted to the requirements and conditions of each polymerization", " 2.2.5.3 purification and storage of monomers in all polymerizations, the purity of the starting materials is of prime importance", "impurities present at concentrations of 10-2-10-4 wt.% often have a considerable influence on the course of the reaction", "with unsaturated monomers the impurities mentioned below may be encountered:  by-products formed during their preparation (e.g., ethylbenzene and divin- ylbenzenes in styrene; acetaldehyde in vinyl acetate); added stabilizers (inhibitors); autoxidation and decomposition products of the monomers (e.g., peroxides in dienes, benzaldehyde in styrene, hydrogen cyanide in acrylonitrile); impurities that derive from the method of storage of the monomer (e.g., traces of metal or alkali from the vessels, tap grease etc.); dimers, trimers, and polymers that are generally soluble in the monomer, but sometimes precipitate, for example, polyac- rylonitrile from acrylonitrile", "likewise, in polycondensation reactions it is impor- tant to remove reactive impurities because they can cause considerable interference during the polyreaction", " the purification procedures to be applied depend on the monomer, the expected impurities, and especially on the purpose for which the monomer is to be employed, e.g., whether it is to be used for radical polymerization in aqueous emulsion or for ionic polymerization initiated with sodium naphthalene", "it is not possible to devise a general purification scheme; instead the most suitable method must be chosen in each case from those given below", "a prerequisite for successful purification is extreme cleanliness of all apparatus (if necessary, treating with hot nitrating acid and repeatedly thorough washing with distilled water)", " the usual procedures of fractional, azeotropic, or extractive distillation under inert gases, crystallization, sublimation, and column chromatography, must be   2.2 techniques for manufacturing of polymers  59  carried out very carefully", "for liquid, water-insoluble monomers (e.g., styrene, example 3.1), it is recommended that phenols or amines which may be present as stabilizers, should first be removed by shaking with dilute alkali or acid, respec- tively; the relatively high volatility of many of these kinds of stabilizers often makes it difficult to achieve their complete removal by distillation", "gaseous monomers (e.g., lower olefins, butadiene, ethylene oxide) can be purified and stored over molecular sieves in order to remove, for example, water or co2", " so-called prepolymerization is frequently used to achieve a very high purifica- tion: a monomer that has already been purified by the normal methods is polymerized to about 10-20% conversion by heating or irradiation, or if necessary by addition of initiator", "it is then separated from the polymer by fractional distilla- tion under nitrogen", "impurities that affect the initiation (e.g., by reaction with the initiator or its fragments) or react with the growing macromolecules (causing chain termination or chain transfer) are thereby removed", " measurements of the common physical constants such as boiling point or refractive index are not sufficiently sensitive to determine the trace amounts of impurities in question", "besides the common spectroscopic methods, techniques like gas chromatography (gc), high-pressure liquid chromatography (hplc), or thin-layer chromatography (tlc) are useful", "the surest criterion for the absence of interfering foreign compounds lies in the polymerization itself: the purifica- tion is repeated until test polymerizations on the course of the reaction under standard conditions are reproducible (conversion-time curve, viscosity number of the polymers)", " storage of monomers and solvents also requires special precautions", "the vessels must be specially constructed and be closed with a self-sealing cap through which the distilled contents can be transferred with a pipette or hypodermic syringe under inert gas", "the contents should also not come in contact with tap grease", " most monomers can be stored unchanged under nitrogen only for short times (hours or days), even in the dark at low temperature", "for long-term storage, a suitable stabilizer is therefore indispensable", "effective stabilizers (inhibitors) of radical polymerization are quinones, phenols, amines, nitro compounds, and some metals or metal compounds", "the addition of 0.1-1 wt.% of hydroquinone or 4-tert- butylpyrocatechol results in sufficient stabilization of many monomers", " water, alcohols, ethers, or amines can cause inhibition of ionic polymerization", "however, these substances can act in different ways according to their concentra- tion", "for example, in polymerizations initiated by lewis acids (bf3 with isobutyl- ene) or organometallic compounds (aluminum alkyls), water in small concentrations behaves as a cocatalyst, but in larger concentrations as an inhibitor (reaction with the initiator or with the ionic propagating species)", " 2.2.5.4 reaction vessels for polymerization reactions

reflux condensers, tap funnels, stirrers and, if needed, a dip-in cooling coil and thermometer or temperature sensor for automatic temperature control", "the flasks should be made from thick-walled glass in order to withstand any internal pressure built up during the reaction and should be sealed off as strain-free as possible", "if strong exothermic reactions are expected, safety precautions must be taken against possible explosion (wrapping round with adhesive tape, protective shield, etc.)", "for safety reasons, ampoules with small volume should be used and should never be filled more than half full", "in the filling process, it is necessary to ensure that none of the content remains adhering to the upper part of the vessel", "using a funnel can easily prevent this", " for many trial experiments it is sufficient to carry out the reaction on a gram scale in round-bottomed or erlenmeyer flasks of 5-10 ml size", "the reaction mixture should be layered with an inert gas using a pipette and should be stirred by using a magnetic bar", "for closure of the reaction flask, a balloon filled with inert gas can be used", "flasks containing higher boiling reaction mixtures can be closed with a convenient taper-ground stopper, which should be protected with a metal clamp", "if needed, a dropping funnel allows, for example, the addition of monomers under inert gas during polymerization", " for reactions in which only a slight pressure rise is expected (e.g., emulsion polymerization of gaseous monomers), thick-walled pressure bottles which are carefully placed behind a protective shield, can be used", "for higher pressures or large-scale experiments, autoclaves are always to be preferred", " for polymerizations initiated by catalyst suspensions (e.g., alkali metals), a suitable high-speed stirrer is used", "it should also be mentioned that high-speed mixers can be used as reaction vessels for polyreactions (interfacial polycon- densations)", "flasks with self-sealing septums made of silicon rubber, used in combination with hypodermic syringes, are very suitable as reaction vessels, especially for ionic polymerizations", "they have the advantage that catalyst can be injected, or samples removed, with practically complete exclusion of air and moisture", "it is recommended to puncture a second hypodermic needle through the septum for pressure compensation while injecting", "likewise, during sample taking, a second hypodermic needle is needed for volume compensation of the inert gas", "if the polymerization is to be initiated by radiation, one generally uses ampoules or cells with well-defined dimensions", "a proper geometrical relationship between the vessel and the radiation source is important", " in (living) anionic polymerizations (e.g., example 3.19) in the laboratory, a vacuum line is often employed; all operations are then conducted under the same, rather high vacuum", "thus, optimum polymer yield and uniformity are secured", " for kinetic investigations of homogeneous polymerizations, a variety of methods and apparatus has been developed", "the dilatometric method is especially worthy of mention on account of

the volume contraction to the yield of polymer can be made by means of a gravi- metrically determined calibration curve or by calculation from the specific volumes (see example 3.6)", " with appropriate precautions, condensation and addition polymerization reactions can be carried out in the same apparatus as customarily used for organic preparative work (see sects", "4.1 and 4.2)", "in order to obtain high molecular weights by polycondensation in solution, a special circulation apparatus can advantageously be used (fig", "2.4)", " exact temperature control is very important for polymerization reactions, since, among other things, the rate and degree of polymerization are strongly dependent on temperature", "for accurate work, for example, for kinetic analysis with a dila- tometer, a thermostat filled with water or paraffin oil may be used instead of thermostatting in the normal way with the aid of a contact thermometer and an immersion heater", " 2.2.5.5 control and termination of polymerization reactions in chain growth polymerization reactions the average molecular weight, the molec- ular weight distribution and in some cases the type of terminal group of the polymer can be varied within certain limits by proper choice of reaction conditions and/or the addition of low-molecular-weight compounds (regulators, chain stoppers)", "it depends on the synthetic method which step is most suitable", " thus, in a radical polymerization an increase of reaction temperature or amount of initiator causes an increase in the number of growing radicals", "since the rate of the propagation reaction is first order with respect to the concentration of growing radicals, while that of the termination reaction is second order, the average mole- cular weight is reduced (with simultaneous increase in rate of polymerization)", "  62  2 methods and techniques for synthesis, characterization, processing  fig", "2.4 circulation apparatus for preparation of polyesters",

vene at high temperatures or high initiator concentrations, the molecular weight is often better controlled by the addition of regulators, i.e., substances with high transfer constants (see sect",

started so that, as a rule, the rate of polymerization is unaffected", "the fragments of the regulator are built into the macromolecule as end groups", "especially suitable as regulators are thiols

to the incor- poration of special endgroups", " in polymerizations with ziegler-natta catalysts, molecular hydrogen is the  preferred regulation agent for controlling the molecular weight", " in many cases (e.g., in kinetic investigations, in determination of the reactivity ratios, or in the preparation of unbranched polymers) it is not appropriate to allow polymerization to proceed to complete conversion of the monomer", "polymerization reactions can be stopped in different ways", "sometimes the reaction can be brought to a halt simply by cooling", "in most cases pouring the reaction mixture, or a sample of it, into a sufficient quantity of precipitant can end the polymerization, whereby the polymer formed is precipitated and the residual monomer and initiator are highly diluted", "polymerizations are most effectively stopped by addition of an inhibitor or some compound that destroys the initiator; the details of this method depend on the type of polymerization", "for radical polymerizations one uses, for example, hydroquinone or hydroquinone monoethers", "most ionic polymerizations can be stopped by addition of water, acids, or bases", "when an ionic polymerization is carried out at low temperature, it is essential to terminate it by destruction of the initiator since otherwise warming to room temperature is likely to make the reaction go very quickly", "organometallic initiators (also ziegler-natta catalysts) can be destroyed with water or alcohols, and lewis acids (bf3) with amines", " control of molecular weight is much simpler for those polymerizations where the macromolecules are built up stepwise (condensation and stepwise addition)", "in such cases, the reaction can be stopped at any time, for example by cooling, so that every step of molecular weight can be obtained", "in principle, the molecular weight of the polymer formed in these reactions can also be controlled or the reaction can be interrupted by changing the molar ratio of the two bifunctional reactants or by adding an appropriate amount of monofunctional compound", " 2.2.5.6 isolation of polymers isolation is simplest when the polymer is insoluble in the reaction mixture and precipitates during its formation", "in these cases, the product can be separated by filtration or centrifugation", "aqueous solutions can be filtered through paper filters; solutions in organic solvents are better filtered through cloth or sintered glass discs", "if the polymer remains dissolved in the reaction mixture, there are two possible ways of proceeding: either the excess monomer, solvent, and other volatiles can be distilled off under vacuum or the polymer can be precipitated by addition of a precipitant", "the first procedure is only applied in exceptional cases, since it generally leads to a resinous polymer contaminated with initiator residues and especially with trapped monomer and solvent", "the most usual procedure is, there- fore, precipitation by means of a precipitant that should satisfy the following requirements: it must be miscible with the monomer and solvent, and dissolve all additives (e.g., initiator) as well as by-products (e.g., oligomers)", "furthermore, the polymer should be nonswellable and should separate in flocculent form (not oily or   64  2 methods and techniques for synthesis, characterization, processing  fig", "2.5

little as possible", " the general procedure is to drop the reaction mixture or polymer solution into a 4- to 10-fold amount of precipitant under vigorous stirring", "the concentration of the polymer solution (generally not above 10%) and the amount of precipitant are chosen so that the polymer precipitates in a flocculent, readily filterable form", "it often happens that the precipitated polymer remains in colloidal suspension; in this case, it may help either to lower the temperature (external cooling or addition of dry ice) or to add electrolytes (solutions of sodium chloride or aluminum sulfate, dilute hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, or ammonia)", "sometimes coagulation of the polymer can also be achieved by prolonged vigorous stirring or shaking (rheopexy)", "polymers that tenaciously retain solvent and tend to resinify can be precipitated   2.3 characterization of macromolecules  65  advantageously by the spray method (see fig", "2.5)", "for this purpose, the polymer solution is sprayed in the form of a mist into the precipitant, thereby producing a fine floccular precipitate, the large surface area of which favors the outward diffusion of unpolymerized monomer and other compounds present", " regarding industrial methods for isolation of polymers, the reader is referred to  the relevant literature", " 2.2.5.7 purification and drying of polymers careful purification and drying of polymers is important not only for analytical characterization, but also because the mechanical, electrical, and optical properties are strongly influenced by impurities", "not the least important aspect of purification is the fact that even traces of impurities may cause or accelerate degradation or crosslinking reactions", "the conventional  techniques for the purification of low-molecular-weight compounds, such as distillation, sublimation, and crystallization, are not applicable to polymers", "in some cases, it is possible to remove the impurities by cold or hot extraction of the finely powdered polymer with suitable solvents or by steam distillation", "separation of low-molecular-weight components from water-soluble polymers (e.g., poly(acrylic acid), poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(acryl amide)) can be accomplished by dialysis or electrodialysis", "however, the most widely used method of purification is by reprecipitation in which the solution of polymer (concentration less than 5-10 wt.%) is dropped into a 4- to 10-fold excess of precipitant, with stirring", "if necessary, this operation is repeated with other solvent/precipitant pairs until the impurities are no longer detectable", " the drying of polymers often presents great difficulty, since many polymers tenaciously retain or trap solvent or precipitant; this phenomenon is termed \u201cocclu- sion\u201d", "the magnitude of this effect can be judged by the following examples", "cyclohexane is occluded so strongly by cellulose that, after drying for 2 days at 100()c and 0.1 mbar, one cyclohexane molecule is still retained for every six cellulose crus", "a 0.2-mm-thick polystyrene film, prepared from a solution in thf by drying to constant weight in a stream of nitrogen at 75()c, still retains 13% thf", " there is no general rule for the prevention or avoidance of occlusion", "in some cases, a change of solvent/precipitant system may help to achieve this goal", "raising the drying temperature is also beneficial", " an important prerequisite for successful drying is to subdivide the polymer as  finely as possible (see sect", "2.5.1)", " 2.3  characterization of macromolecules  for the unequivocal characterization of a low-molecular-weight compound, it is sufficient to specify a few physical or chemical properties, for example, boiling point, melting point, angle of optical rotation, refractive index, elemental analysis,   66  2 methods and techniques for synthesis, characterization, processing  ir and nmr spectra", "if two low-molecular-weight samples have the same charac- teristic properties, they may be considered as identical", " the characterization of macromolecular substances is considerably more diffi- cult", "owing to the high intermolecular forces, macromolecules are not volatile without decomposition and so, no boiling point can be determined", "the melting points of partially crystalline polymers are generally not sharp", "amorphous polymers frequently show only sintering or softening, often accompanied by decomposition", "in addition to elemental analysis, other data must be determined, for example, solubility, viscosity of the solution, mean molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, and degree of crystallinity", " the fundamental difficulty is that polymeric substances cannot be obtained in a structurally and molecularly uniform state, unlike low-molecular-weight compounds", "thus, macromolecular materials of the same analytical composition may differ not only in their structure and configuration (see sect", "1.2) but also in molecular size and molecular weight distribution; they are polydisperse, i.e., they consist of mixtures of molecules of different size", "hence, it is understandable that the expression \u201cidentical\u201d is not, in practice, applicable to macromolecules", "up to the present time, there is no possibility of preparing macromolecules of absolutely uniform structure and size", "it follows, therefore, that physical measurements on polymers can only yield average values", "the aforementioned peculiarities of macromolecular substances mean that the methods of characterization suitable for low-molecular-weight compounds are frequently not applicable or only applicable in a substantially modified form; often completely new methods of investigation must be employed", " since the properties of a polymer can be noticeably influenced by small variations in the molecular structure, and these in turn depend on the preparation conditions, it is necessary when reporting data to indicate not only the type of measurement (e.g., molecular weight by end group analysis; crystallinity by infra- red measurement or by x-ray diffraction; etc.), but

"this is because of the very high extinction coefficients of most chromophors and the fact that the extinction must not exceed a certain value in order to maintain the validity of the lambert beer law (see above)", "if this is the case, quantitative interpretation of the uv-vis spectra is possible", "as indicated, however, uv-vis spectroscopy is limited to polymers that contain specific chromophores such as aromatic groups, conjugated double- or triple bonds, carbonyls or azo-subunits: when molecules absorb light in the uv-vis range, electronic transitions are induced in the molecules between electronic levels (usu- ally \u03c0 ! \u03c0* and n ! \u03c0* transitions in the most important range of wave length, i.e., between 200 nm and 600 nm)", "these transitions can be used for the quantitative determination of residual monomers in a polymer or of copolymer composition (e.g., copolymers of styrene)", "however, application of the lambert-beer\u2019s law might be affected here in some cases since the observed chromophors have a different next neighbors environment in these macromolecules", "for example, in copolymers containing repeating units a and b with a chromophoric subunit in a, the extinction coefficient of the chromophor at maximum absorption (lmax) might depend on whether it is the center of triades aaa, aab, or bab", "thus the possibility of quantitative evaluation has to be checked first by means of reference experiments in these cases", "also, configurational and constitutional features of macromolecules can be determined", "in the case of conjugated p systems, for example, the p ! p* absorptions shift towards longer wavelengths at increasing conjugation length", " last but not least, ageing and destruction processes can be monitored

surrounding medium", "even though uv-vis spectroscopy is not very specific in the absorption band, it is highly sensitive and therefore much better than nmr or ir spectroscopy to detect small amounts of chromophors", " 2.3.2.4 fluorescence spectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy is commonly used to characterize fluorescence effects in the uv and visual range of the electromagnetic spectrum", "such fluorescence is caused by the fact that the absorption of uv or visible light of specific wavelengths causes excitation of electrons within a molecule", "if radiating relaxation occurs directly from the singlet s1 state, the process is called fluorescence", " readily measurable fluorescence intensities are found for molecules having aromatic and heteroaromatic rings, in particular when annulated rings are present, and in the case of conjugated p-electron systems", "if the polymer molecules contain such fluorescence-active subunits they can be characterized by this technique, either directly via their fluorescence spectrum or via fluorescence quenching experiments (for polymers with appropriate quencher groups)", "it is also possible to introduce a very small amount of fluorescent-active groups (as comonomer units; \u201cfluorescence marker\u201d) into a polymer", "inspection through a fluorescence micro- scope allows, for example, the monitoring of the molecule\u2019s movements (brownian motions in solution, segment motions in the bulk above glass transition), or the determination of chain orientation in stretched samples", "in polymer materials and composites, fluorescence spectroscopy can be used for the qualitative and quantita- tive determination of additives (stabilizers, for example) even when present at very high dilution only", "this is possible due to the tremendous sensitivity of fluorescence spectroscopy", " 2.3.2.5 refractometry the refractive index is an important quantity for characterizing the structure of polymers", "this is because it depends sensitively on the chemical composition, on the tacticity, and - for oligomeric samples - also on the molecular weight of a macromolecular substance", "the refractive indices nd (determined using the sodium d line) of many polymers are collected in the literature", "in order to characterize a molecule\u2019s constitution one requires knowledge of the mole refraction, rg", "for isotropic samples, it can be calculated in good approximation by the lorentz- lorenz equation:  rg \u00bc  () vg;mol  n2 () 1 n2 \u00fe 2  (2.15)   2.3 characterization of macromolecules  79  where rg is the mole refraction per monomer unit and vg,mol is the base mole volume", "rg can be calculated from well-known atom- and bond refraction increments", "in the case of ideal mixtures the mole refractions behave additively like the specific volume of the components", "for transparent samples, refractometry is therefore a well-appropriate technique for the determination of the polymeri- zation kinetics - similar to dilatometry - and the characterization of mixtures (polymer solutions, compatibility etc.)", " 2.3.2.6 elemental analysis qualitative and quantitative elemental analysis of polymers can be carried out by the conventional methods used for low-molecular-weight compounds", "so a detailed description is not needed here", "elemental analysis or determination of functional groups is especially valuable for copolymers or chemically modified polymers", "for homopolymers where the elemental analysis should agree with that of the mono- mer, deviations from the theoretical values are an indication of side reactions during polymerization", "however, they can also sometimes be caused by inclusion or adsorption of solvent or precipitant, or, in commercial polymers, to the presence of added stabilizers", "the preparation of the sample for analysis must, therefore, be very carefully carried out (several reprecipitations, if necessary using various solvent/precipitant combinations; thorough drying)", " 2.3.2.7 composition of copolymers in the characterization of copolymers one distinguishes between qualitative analy- sis, designed to test whether the material is a genuine copolymer or only a physical mixture of homopolymers, and quantitative analysis of the weight fraction of the incorporated comonomers", " the qualitative analysis is quite simple if the homopolymers differ in their solubility, for example, when one homopolymer is soluble in a solvent where the other is not", "in this case a sample of the material is extracted with that solvent", "the reprecipitated extracts and residues are examined for composition", "the extraction must, however, be very carefully carried out and repeated several times since polymer mixtures are frequently quite difficult to separate by extraction", "if no pure homopolymer is isolated in this way one can be sure that the sample is a genuine copolymer", "if the solubility properties of the original homopolymers are insufficiently different it is sometimes possible to induce such differences through chemical transformation, for example, by oxidation and/or hydrolysis", " the qualitative investigation of copolymers is considerably more difficult when the homopolymers cannot be distinguished by their solubility", "in this case other physical data of the supposed copolymer can be compared with the corresponding data for various physical mixtures of homopolymers, for example, softening point and melting range, density, and crystallinity", "copolymers can frequently be distin- guished from physical mixtures of homopolymers by the qualitative and quantita- tive composition of their pyrolysis products", " quantitative analysis of copolymers is relatively simple if one of the comon- omers contains a readily determinable element or functional group", "however, c,h   80  2 methods and techniques for synthesis, characterization, processing  elemental analyses are only of value when the difference between the carbon or hydrogen content of the two comonomers is sufficiently large", "if the composition cannot be determined by elemental analysis or chemical means, the problem can be solved usually either by spectroscopic methods, for example, by uv measurements (e.g., styrene copolymers), by ir measurements (e.g., olefin copolymers), and by nmr measurements, or by gas chromatographic methods combined with mass spectroscopy after thermal or chemical decomposition of the samples", " in principle the composition of a copolymer may also be determined by analyzing the composition of the residual monomer by a suitable method after polymerization", "it will usually be necessary first to separate the copolymer by precipitation, followed by careful recovery of the filtrate containing the residual monomer, but the direct method of analysis of the copolymer will generally be preferred", "block and graft copolymers can be characterized in the same manner", "however, consideration must be taken of the fact that they usually contain large amounts of the homopolymers which must first be removed", "the more refined characterization of a statistic copolymer

are therefore called polydisperse", "as a consequence, chemical formulas of polymers are gener- ally given in a way where the constitutional repeating unit is drawn in square brackets, bearing an index n indicating the average number of repeating units tied together to give the polymer chain", "full characterization of a macromolecular substance is not an easy task, therefore, and quite often

resulting mechanical properties tremendously", "therefore, we will give a short introduction into methods that allow us to determine the required information", "roughly, the methods developed for the determination of molecular weights are subdivided into absolute and relative methods: absolute methods provide the molecular weight and the degree of polymer-ization without any calibration", "their calculation from the experimental data requires only universal constants such as the gas constant and avogadro\u2019s number, apart from readily determinable physical properties such as density, refractive index, etc", "the most important methods in use today are mass spectrometry, osmome- try, light scattering, and - to some extent - sedimentation and diffusion measurements", "also, some chemical and spectroscopic methods (determination of end-groups) are important because of their relative simplicity", " relative methods measure properties that depend clearly on molecular weight, for example, the hydrodynamic volume of the polymer coils (gpc, viscosimetry) or their solubility as a function of chain length", "however, these measurements can only be evaluated with respect to the molecular weight of the macromolecules if experimental calibration curves are available which were generated by compar- ison with an absolute method of molecular-weight determination", "a necessary prerequisite for application of the above methods is that the polymer is soluble in a suitable solvent", "moreover, one must ensure that the dissolved macromolecules exist as isolated species and do not form associates or aggregates", "proof of this can be obtained by carrying out reactions on functional groups of the polymer that do not lead to cleavage of the polymer chains", "if the degree of polymerization of the original polymer agrees with that of the modified polymer, association can be excluded", "values of molecular weight determined in different solvents should also be in agreement if association is absent", " 2.3.3.2 absolute methods end-group analysis if the macromolecules in a polymeric sample contain end groups which can be readily detected, analytically identified and quantified, and if the macromolecule\u2019s molecular weight is not too high (<5 () 104), their number-average molecular weight, mn, can be determined by chemical as well as by physical methods", "specific and very exact analytical methods must be applied here since the end groups to be estimated constitute only a small fraction of the macromolecule (less than 0.5%, depending on the molecular weight)", "chemical methods are based mainly on titrations of the end groups", "the most common procedure is potentiometric ph titration", "elemental analysis or trace analysis might be appropriate as well (halogen analysis, for example, when p-dibromobenzoyl peroxide has been used as the initiator in a radical polymerization)", "physical methods are based on spectroscopic techniques such as ir, uv-vis (when azo compounds with characteristic absorption bands are used as initiator, for example), and nmr spectroscopy (especially for polymers made by step-growth polymerization)", "in the early

that it must be absolutely clear what kind of end groups are present in a polymeric material and - if more than one kind of end group is present - how they are distributed over the material (one per chain, two per chain, more than two per macromolecule for branched systems etc.)", "in order to assure well-defined end groups, the macro- molecules formed by radical polymerization can be labeled by choosing a suitable initiator (or chain transfer agent) whose radical fragments become incorporated into the polymer", "in this case it is also important to know the type of chain termination since this determines the number of labeled end groups per macromolecule (two for termination by combination, one for termination by disproportionation)", "errors can occur if, for example, there is uncontrolled chain transfer to the monomer which reduces the number of labeled end groups per molecule", "as a consequence, end- group analysis will lead to a too high apparent molecular weight", "the molecular weights of macromolecules made by step-growth polymerization involving two compounds can also be obtained by end-group determination", "in particular, the amino, hydroxyl, and carboxyl end-groups in polyesters and polyamides can be estimated very precisely both by potentiometric ph titration and by colorimetry", "hydroxy end groups (e.g., in polyoxymethylenes) can also be determined by acetylation or methylation", " the number-average molecular weight is calculated from the analytically deter-  mined end-group content according to the following relationship:  mn \u00bc  100 () z

samples to be analyzed are very pure", "in particular low-molecular-weight impurities have to be removed reliably", "otherwise, they will migrate through the semipermeable membrane and lower the chemical potential of the solvent in the reference chamber", "an overestimation of the molecular weight will follow", "the same effect applies when there are very small oligomers in the test sample", "therefore, the lower limit of m for application of membrane osmometry is approx", "10.000 - depending on the available membrane pore size", "on the other hand, m should be below approx", "50.000

for a standard method of polymer analysis", "therefore, the effect of vapor pressure lowering is measured indirectly by determining the increase of the solution temperature (due to the heat of condensation) when the solution is in contact with a saturated atmosphere of solvent vapor", "here, two adjusted thermistors are placed in a tempered cell containing a saturated solvent atmosphere", "one of the thermistors bears a drop of the pure solvent, the other one a drop of the polymer solution (in the same solvent)", "the drop of the pure solvent assumes precisely the temperature of the measuring cell because condensation and evaporation of solvent molecules is balanced in the saturated atmosphere", "in the polymer solution, however, the activity of the solvent molecules is decreased due to the presence of the polymer and thus their vapor pressure is lowered", "consequently, some more solvent condensates onto the solution drop and due to the condensation heat its temperature rises", "finally, its temperature is higher than the surrounding temperature by dt*", "this temperature difference is just enough to compensate the lowered vapor pressure of the solution, and the chemical potentials of the solvent are now identical in the solution and in the pure solvent", "(in practice, however, this temperature difference dt* is never reached completely because the experiment cannot be carried out adiabatically", "continuously, the solution drop loses some heat to the surrounding vapor phase", "therefore, a slightly lower temperature difference dt is measured

electromagnetic radiation excites electrons bound to atoms or molecules", "if the energy of the radiation is insufficient - i.e., the wavelength is too long - to cause a transition from the electronic ground state into an electronically excited one, the excited electrons fall back immediately after excitation while they emit the absorbed radiation again in all directions in space", "this light is

rheological investigations characterizing structural changes, capillary rheometers and especially high pressure capillary rheometers give information about the processability of the polymer at high shear rates, as they apply in extrusion or injection molding", " simplified versions of capillary rheometers are melt flow testers, which are especially suitable for laboratory use since they are

distributed evenly on the substrate", "when thin specimens are examined using positive phase contrast optics, they appear darker than the surrounding medium when the refractive index of the specimen

passing through them", "in anisotropic materials, in contrast, optical properties vary with the orientation of incident light with the crystallographic axes", "they demonstrate a range of refractive indices, depending both on the propagation direction of light through the substance and on the vibrational plane coordinates", "more importantly, anisotropic materials act as beam splitters and divide

industries", " probe microscopes are characterized by two common features", "on the one hand, a sharp, tiny probe gets very close to the sample and feels the surface by monitoring some kind of interaction between the probe and the surface, which is very sensitive to distance", "on the other hand, the sample is scanned in a raster fashion with near atomic accuracy, and the variation in the interaction is translated into a topographic map of the surface", " among the family of spms the two most commonly used are scanning tunneling microscopy (stm) and atomic force microscopy (afm)", "in stm, a sharp metallic probe and a conducting sample are brought together until their   2.3 characterization of macromolecules  127  electronic wave functions overlap", "by applying a potential bias between them, a tunneling current is produced", "the probe is mounted on a piezoelectric drive that scans the surface", "combining the piezoelectric drive with a feedback loop allows imaging of the surface in either a constant current or a constant-height mode", "in afm, the probe tip is attached to a cantilever with a small spring constant", "the probe is much like a spring which changes dimension upon experiencing a force and the interaction that will be monitored is the repulsion between two atoms when they are brought extremely close to each other", "the forces acting on the probe tip deflect the cantilever and the tip displacement is proportional to the force between the surface and the tip", "the resultant bending of the afm cantilever is measured optically by the deflection of the reflected laser beam", "the most important advan- tage that afm has over stm is that the former is not limited to conducting samples, so materials can often be imaged \u201cas is\u201d with essentially no sample preparation as long as the surface roughness is not too high", "while the technique of afm is maturing, many afm modes have appeared for special purposes", "the most com- mon techniques are contact mode, non-contact mode, and tapping mode", " in the contact mode the tip scans the sample in close contact with the surface", "the force on the tip is repulsive with a mean value of 10-9 n", "this force is set by pushing the cantilever against the sample surface with a piezoelectric positioning element", "in contact mode afm the deflection of the cantilever is sensed and compared in a dc feedback amplifier to some desired value of deflection", "if the measured deflection is different from the desired value, the feedback amplifier applies a voltage to the piezo to raise or lower the sample relative to the cantilever in order to restore the desired value of deflection", "the voltage that the feedback amplifier applies to the piezo is a measure of the height of features on the sample surface", "it is displayed as a function of the lateral position of the sample", " problems with contact mode are caused by excessive tracking forces applied by the probe to the sample", "the effects can be reduced by minimizing tracking force of the probe on the sample", "moreover, under ambient conditions, sample surfaces are covered by a layer of adsorbed gases consisting primarily of water vapor and nitrogen which is 10-30 monolayers thick", "when the probe touches this contami- nant layer, a meniscus forms and the cantilever is pulled by surface tension toward the sample surface", "the magnitude of the force depends on the details of the probe geometry, but is typically on the order of 100 nn", "this meniscus force and other attractive forces may be neutralized by operating with the probe and part or the entire sample totally immersed in liquid", " an attempt to avoid these problems is the non-contact mode", "this technique is used in situations where tip contact might alter the sample in subtle ways", "in this mode the tip hovers 50-150 angstroms ngstrom above the sample surface", "attractive van der waals forces acting between the tip and the sample are detected, and topographic images are constructed by scanning the tip above the surface", "unfortunately the attractive forces from the sample are substantially weaker than the forces used by contact mode", "therefore the tip must be given a small oscillation so that ac detection methods can be used to detect the small forces between the tip and the sample by measuring the change in amplitude, phase, or frequency of the oscillating   128  2 methods and techniques for synthesis, characterization, processing  cantilever in response to force gradients from the sample", "for highest resolution, it is necessary to measure force gradients from van der waals forces which may extend only a nanometer from the sample surface", "in general, the fluid contaminant layer is substantially thicker than the range of the van der waals force gradient and therefore, attempts to image the true surface with non-contact afm fails as the oscillating probe becomes trapped in the fluid layer or hovers beyond the effective range of the forces it attempts to measure", " tapping mode is a key advance in afm", "this potent technique allows high- resolution topographic imaging of sample surfaces that are easily damaged, loosely hold to their substrate, or difficult to image by other afm techniques", "tapping mode overcomes problems associated with friction, adhesion, electrostatic forces, and other difficulties that plague conventional afm scanning methods by alter- nately placing the tip in contact with the surface to provide high resolution and then lifting the tip off the surface to avoid dragging the tip across the surface", "tapping mode imaging is implemented in ambient air by oscillating the cantilever assembly at or near the cantilever\u2019s resonant frequency using a piezoelectric crystal", "the piezo motion causes the cantilever to oscillate with a high amplitude (typically greater than 20 nm) when the tip is not in contact with the surface", "the oscillating tip is then moved toward the surface until it begins to lightly touch, or tap the surface", "during scanning, the vertically oscillating tip alternately contacts the surface and lifts off, generally at a frequency of 50,000-500,000 cycles per second", "as the oscillating cantilever begins to intermittently contact the surface, the canti- lever oscillation is necessarily reduced due to energy loss caused by the tip contacting the surface", "the reduction in oscillation amplitude is used to identify and measure surface features", " in addition to these topographic measurements, afm can also provide much more information", "the afm can also record the amount of force felt by the cantilever as the probe tip is brought close to - and even indented into - a sample surface and then pulled away", "this technique can be used to measure the long-range attractive or repulsive forces between the probe tip and the sample surface, elucidating local chemical and mechanical properties like adhesion and elasticity, and even thickness of adsorbed molecular layers or bond rupture lengths", "phase images allow to distinguish between softer and harder domains on the sample surface", " studies on fundamental interactions between surfaces extend across physics, chemistry, materials science, and a variety of other disciplines", "with a force sensitivity on the order of a few pico-newtons, afms are excellent tools for probing these fundamental force interactions", "force measurements in water revealed the benefits of afm imaging in this environment due to the lower tip- sample forces", "some of the most interesting force measurements have also been performed with samples under liquids where the environment can be quickly changed to adjust the concentration of various

factors not characteristic of the material, such as the form of the penetrating body (ball or needle) and the time factor", "unfortunately, there is no universal hardness test and numerous methods are in use, many of which do not cover the entire range of possible hardness and can, therefore, not be used on all polymers", "these methods can be divided into two   136  2 methods and techniques for

under full load", "the latter methods are the most suitable for thermoplastics, thermosets, and elastomers", "a very popular method is the ball hardness test: a steel ball (diameter 5 mm) is pressed into the sample (4-mm-thick plate) with constant force and the depth of penetration measured after 10 s and after 60 s loading", "since the area of deformation must be taken into account, ball hardness has the dimensions n/mm2", "the hardness values measured with different methods cannot be interconverted because each of these gives different results", "for example, according to the brinell method a rubber is very hard, because the permanent deformation is measured", "in contrast, the ball pressure method points out the soft character of the polymer because the permanent and elastic deformation is simultaneously measured", " the hardness of a polymer can also be estimated from the modulus of elasticity e (high e modulus indicates high hardness)", "the advantage here is that every

an influence on the properties in solution and in bulk", "nearly all properties are dependent on the molecular weight", "some values increase more or less steadily with growing chain length, e.g., solution viscosity, others increase very fast from oligomers to polymers and then reach a plateau, in particular, many mechanical properties", " it is important to mention that the structure/properties relationships which will be discussed in the following section are valid for many polymer classes and not only for one specific macromolecule", "in addition, the properties of polymers are influenced by the morphology of the liquid or solid state", "for example, they can be amorphous or crystalline and the crystalline shape can be varied", "multiphase compositions like block copolymers and polymer blends exhibit very often unusual meso- and nano-morphologies", "but in contrast to the synthesis of a special chemical structure, the controlled modification of the

properties of polymers  137  2.4.1 structure/properties relationships in homopolymers  2.4.1.1 correlations with solution properties is determined by the interactions between the solubility of

more complicated than for a low-molecular-weight compound", "nevertheless, some general rules do exist: \u2022 a decisive and general role is played by the molecular weight: the higher the molecular weight, the lower is the solubility of the polymer and the higher is the solution viscosity at given conditions", " \u2022 amorphous polymers dissolve much easier than crystalline ones", "the latter are often soluble at elevated temperatures only, i.e., near the crystallite melting point tm", " \u2022 polar groups in a macromolecule mostly enhance solubility", "\u2022 short chain branches increase solubility", "\u2022 macromolecules with polar and stiff main chains (e.g., cellulose, polyaramides)  are often only soluble via complexation", " \u2022 crosslinking reduces the solubility dramatically", "medium or highly crosslinked polymers do not dissolve at all but form more or less swollen gels, depending on the degree of crosslinking", "in a similar way, some general rules can be derived for the viscosity of polymer  solutions: \u2022 the solution viscosity increases strongly with the molecular weight", "\u2022 branched polymers show lower solution viscosities than linear ones with the  same molecular weight", " \u2022 the degree of stereoregularity is in general only of very small influence on the  solution viscosity for polymers with the same molecular weight", " \u2022 the stiffness of the main chain of a polymer is of great importance for the solution viscosity: the stiffer the chain is, the higher is the viscosity for polymers with the same molecular weight (see sect", "2.3.3.3.1 for the dependency of k and a in the viscosity equation on the shape of macromolecules in solution)", " 2.4.1.2 correlation with bulk properties thermal properties the thermal properties of polymers include their behavior during heating from the solid amorphous (glassy) or crystalline to the liquid (molten) state, but also their chemical and mechanical stability in the entire range of application", " in industrial practice temperature stability of a polymer means that it is able to maintain its mechanical properties up to a certain temperature and over a certain time period", "depending on the environmental conditions under which the thermal stability is measured one further differentiates between two cases: physical ther- mostability if the thermal treatment occurs in inert atmosphere and chemical   138  2 methods and techniques for synthesis, characterization, processing  thermostability if the thermal treatment is done, e.g., in the presence of air (thermooxidative stability)", " the prediction of the chemical thermostability is based on the rules established for the thermal stability and the reactivity of chemical bonds for low-molecular- weight compounds", "instead, the physical thermostability depends on the transition points of the macromolecules, i.e., the glass transition temperature tg in case of amorphous polymers, and additionally the crystalline melting point tm in case of crystalline polymers", " in designing polymers with high physical stability valuable information is  obtained from the gibbs equation:  this equation shows that a high melting temperature tm is obtained by raising the melt enthalpy dh and/or a lowering of the melt entropy ds", "since tm and tg are related via the boyer/beaman rule (see sect", "2.3.4.3), this equation is also valid for the glass transition temperature", " the glass transition temperature tg increases in the beginning rapidly with the molecular weight and reaches a plateau at high molecular weights", "according to fox and flory the relation between tg and the number average molecular weight mn is given by:  tm \u00bc  dh ds  tg \u00bc tg;1 ()  k mn  where tg,1 is the glass transition temperature at very (infinitely) high mn and k is a constant", "but it should be taken into consideration that this proportionality between tg and mn is only valid for limited regions of mn", "crosslinking, stereoregularity (sometimes combined with crystallinity) and chain stiffness in general result in an increase of the glass transition temperature, whereas tg decreases with branching", "similar rules also hold for the dependencies of the crystallite melting point on the molecular weight, stereoregularity, chain stiffness and branching", "crosslinked polymers in most cases are amorphous and do not crystallize", " the crystallinity and the corresponding density and melting temperature of the crystalline domains of (semi)crystalline polymers depend also on the molecular weight", "first, with growing molecular weight the degree of crystallinity increases to a maximum, with further growing the degree of crystallinity drops a little due to changes in the kinetics of crystallization with increasing melt viscosity and the participation of some of the polymer chains in the formation of different crystallites, which hinders the growth of the crystallites", "therefore the rate of crystallization of very high-molecular-weight chains is slower than that of chains with lower molecular weight", "this is also the reason why the rate of the growth of spherulites of isotactic polystyrene decreases with increasing molecular weight", "  2.4 correlations of structure and morphology with the properties of polymers  139  table 2.12 selected

melting temperature in order to reduce the high viscosity of the polymer melt", "in this processing technique the polymer is heated above its melting or softening point, the viscous melt is brought into the desired form by mechanical forces and the formed object is finally cooled", "this procedure is very widely applicable and allows the preparation of objects in practically any size or shape,

time, must be determined empirically in every case", "if the film is opaque, the temperature was probably too low", "if it is too thin or contains gas bubbles (decomposition) the temperature was too high", "finally, the rate of cooling can also affect the properties of the film", "sometimes the aluminum foils can only be removed from the polymer film with difficulty; rapid cooling (with water or in a freezer) or prior coating of the aluminum foils with silicone oil or with an aqueous dispersion of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) usually prevents sticking", " if a suitable press is not available,

off the glass plate", "an approximately 20% solution is usually about right, but the best conditions must be established by experiment", "in order to obtain a film of uniform thickness the glass plate must be as level as possible and the polymer solution evenly distributed", "this may be achieved most easily with the aid of a glass rod wrapped at both ends with some tape or twine", "for more

example, in a drying chamber at 80()c for a few minutes)", "the coated glass plate is cautiously immersed in water, whereby after about 1-5 min an optically opaque film which shows an internal pore structure, detaches from the glass plate", "after the exchange of the organic solvent by water, the film is dried and can be used as a separating membrane for, e.g., the deionization of sea water",

polymerization can in several cases be initiated by subjecting the unsatu- rated monomer to light or high energy radiation", "a very versatile variant of photopolymerization is the use of photolabile compounds as initiators which upon irradiation are fragmented to form radicals", "this generation of radicals can occur in two ways", "in the first case the photoinitiator itself absorbs light and decomposes", "in the second case the photoinitiator is not able to absorb the light directly", "instead, a second compound (sensitizer) is needed to absorb the light and to transfer the   172  3 synthesis of macromolecules by chain growth polymerization  energy to the photoinitiator which than decomposes immediately", "some typical uv-initiators are benzoin, benzoin ether, benzil, and benzil ketals", "especially useful for the initiation of a radical polymerization in the visible spectral range of light is the yellow-colored campherquinone", " photoinitiation is limited to thin layers due to the low penetration of light, nevertheless it possesses several advantages compared to the common techniques", "thus, it is possible to control the rate and degree of polymerization and also the number and length of crosslinks, by the intensity of light", " these advantages are commercially used in the so-called photolithography, a technique that allows the production of very tiny and accurate nanometer scale structures on the surface of semiconductors (e.g., silicon wafers)", " the principles of photolithography are as follows: onto the surface of a semi- conductor is spread a thin film of a photosensitive composition that consists of several chemicals", "this composition is called photoresist and it is characterized by the effect that it changes its solubility upon irradiation", "thus, when the thin film is irradiated through a mask, the structure of this mask is projected onto the film which changes its solubility at the exposed segments", "if the photoresist contains also bi- or higher functional monomers (example 3.13), then crosslinked and insoluble polymers are formed", "by treatment with a solvent the nonirradiated parts of the photoresist-film are removed while the crosslinked polymer remains on the surface of the substrate as an image of the structured mask, i.e., the structure of the integrated circuit", "without photolithography the modern microelectronics would not be possible", " the same principle is also applied in the manufacturing of printing plates for modern printing processes", "moreover, photopolymerization is used for coating of metals or wood and it finds also application in dentistry", " example 3.13 photopolymerization of hexamethylene bisacrylate safety precautions: before this experiment is carried out, sect", "2.2.5

long as two arbitrary reference values are assumed", "for this purpose price took the values for styrene as q 0.8", "q and e values can then be obtained for all monomers that are copolymerizable with styrene", "these monomers in their turn can serve as reference compounds for further determinations with other monomers that do not copolymerize with styrene", "one of the main advantages of the so-called q,e scheme is that the data can be presented in the form of a diagram instead of very complex tables of reactivity ratios", " \u00bc ()  \u00bc  obviously the precision of this procedure is not very great, since the assu- mptions underlying the calculations of q and e values can be regarded as best as semiquantitative", "however, it has been shown that when the reactivity ratios are back-calculated from the q,e values, quite good agreement is obtained with the experimental values, so that it is possible to make useful predictions of reactivity ratios for monomer pairs not previously investigated", "on the other hand, it is questionable whether any theoretical conclusions should be drawn from the q and e values concerning the behavior of different monomers", "thus, the e value of a monomer as a measure of the charge should be dependent on the nature of the solvent used for polymerization; but it has been shown, for example, that the copolymerization of styrene with methyl methacrylate in solvents of different dielectric constant (benzene 2.28, methanol 33.7, acetonitrile 38.8) give the same reactivity ratios, which should not really be the case if the foregoing assumptions are correct", "a broadening of the basis of the q,e scheme has therefore been suggested by various people", "these further considerations permit somewhat deeper theoretical conclusions", " in most cases one of the two monomers is preferentially incorporated into the copolymer, so that the composition of the monomer mixture changes with increas- ing conversion, as also does the composition of the polymer chains", "therefore it is important, when determining reactivity ratios, to work at low conversions, so that at the end of the experiment the ratio of monomer concentrations is essentially the same as at the beginning", "however, if high conversions are needed for preparative purposes, constant composition can be achieved by adding the more reactive monomer in a programmed manner (see example 3.39)", " the determination of the reactivity ratios requires a knowledge of the composi- tion of the copolymers made from particular monomer mixtures; numerous analyt- ical methods are available (see sect", "2.3.2)", "in principle, it is possible to calculate r1 and r2, using eq", "3.18, from the composition of only two copolymers that have been obtained from two different mixtures of the two monomers ml and m2", "however, it   3.4 copolymerization  233  is more precise to determine the composition of the copolymers from several monomer mixtures and to

graphical clearness", " in the literature one can find extensive compilations of reactivity ratios for numerous monomer pairs", "for evaluation of the copolymerization experiments and for calculating the reactivity ratios, there is now extensive software available", "in copolymerizations of three monomers there are nine growing steps to be taken into account", "from these, six reactivity ratios can be derived", "they are difficult to obtain from terpolymerizations and are therefore taken from binary copolymerizations", " the statistical (random) copolymerization is an often used possibility in indus- try to change the properties of a polymeric compound", "by incorporation of small amounts of a comonomer, the mechanical properties (hardness, stiffness) are almost maintained but other properties can intentionally be changed", "thus, by incorporation of small amounts of vinyl acetate into poly(vinyl chloride), the glass transition temperature is slightly lowered and an internal plasticization is achieved", "the ability of synthetic fibers to take up dyes can be improved by incorporation of small amounts of comonomers with functional groups that confer a greater affinity towards organic dyestuffs", "polar groups also improve the printability of films and the stability of aqueous copolymer lattices", "significant differences in solubility between copolymers and the corresponding homopolymers are usually observed", "the incorporation of larger amounts of comonomers leads then to larger changes in the mechanical properties", "thus, while polyethylene and isotactic polypropylene are crystalline polymers with the characteristic properties of a thermoplastic material, copolymers of ethylene and propylene are over a wide range of composi- tion amorphous, rubber-elastic products", " alternating copolymerization is a rare event", "but when it occurs, the resulting copolymers exhibit unusual properties provided a 100% alternation was achieved (see sect", "2.4)  crosslinking copolymerization is also of great practical importance", "such copo- lymerization is achieved by taking compounds with two or more polymerizable double bonds and copolymerizing them with simple unsaturated monomers to form three-dimensional network materials", "for example, crosslinked polystyrene is prepared by copolymerizing styrene with small amounts of divinylbenzene (exam- ple 3.41)", "these crosslinked polymers are insoluble and nonfusible; however, depending on the degree of crosslinking, they swell to a limited extent in organic   3.4 copolymerization  235  solvents and find application, for example, in the preparation of ion-exchange resins (see sect", "5.2)", "the copolymerization of unsaturated polyesters (made from maleic or fumaric acid) with styrene is also a crosslinking copolymerization", "some non- conjugated dienes can polymerize radically via a cyclization propagation step to yield linear chains containing cyclic repeat units (so-called cyclopolymerization)", "thus, in the polymerization of acrylic anhydride this tendency to ring formation is so great that the intramolecular reaction occurs almost to the exclusion of the intermolecular crosslinking reaction:  r  o  o  o  o  o  o  the rates and degrees of polymerizations in radical copolymerizations conform essentially to the same laws as for radical homopolymerization

effect", "however, these assertions are valid only for a given monomer compo- sition; in many cases the copolymerization rate depends very much on monomer composition and can pass through a pronounced minimum or maximum", " as already discussed for homopolymerization, radical copolymerizations can be carried out in bulk, in solution, and in dispersion", "the composition of the copolymer obtained in suspension or emulsion may be different from that obtained by poly- merization in bulk or solution if one of the monomers is more soluble in water than the other", "in such a case the composition of

technique required for ionic copolymerizations, as compared with ionic homopolymerizations", "however, the type of initiator and the solvent have a potential influence on the course of ionic copolymerizations as well as on the composition of the copolymers so that the optimum conditions for each monomer pair must be individually determined", " finally, it should be mentioned that there exist two other routes for the synthesis of copolymers", "first the partial chemical conversion of homopolymers (see sect", "5.1), for example, the partial hydrolysis of poly(vinyl acetate)",

which the macromolecular skeleton remains intact are called \u201cpolymer-analogous\u201d reactions because principally they are analogous to the corresponding reactions in low-molecular-weight chemistry", "they play an important role in the elucidation of the structure of macromolecular compounds", "in the development of macromolecu- lar chemistry, polymer-analogous reactions on polystyrenes, for example, were also of fundamental significance in leading to the recognition that polymers are com- posed of macromolecules and do not consist of some form of associates of low- molecular-weight compounds", " in chemical  reactions between low-molecular-weight compounds, new substances are formed that can, in principle, be separated from the unconverted reactants and by-products, e.g., by means of chromatography", "with chemical reactions of macromolecular substances the situation is more complicated in that the main reaction and side reactions take place on the same molecular framework", "if, for example, only 80 out of 100 crus in a polymer chain react in the desired sense while the rest either does not react at all or reacts in some other way, the remaining 20 units cannot be separated from the others since they all belong to the same macromolecule", "consequently, one cannot obtain a chemically uniform reaction product", " due to the generally different molecular weights of the crus of reactant, main product, and by-product in the reaction of a macromolecule, it is necessary to define the yield or conversion in a special way (see eqs", "5.3 and 5.4)", " changes in reactivity and reaction kinetics in comparison to conversions of low- molecular-weight substances can also be attributed to the fact that macromolecules in solution are in a more or less coiled state", "during the course of a reaction this state changes through alteration of the solubility parameters, thus facilitating or aggravating conversion", "finally one observes influences on the type and grade of tacticity during the conversion of stereoregularly built macromolecular substances [e.g., saponification of poly(methacrylates)]", "  326  5 modification of macromolecular substances  a limitation of the conversion for statistical reasons is always expected when two neighboring units of the macromolecule take part in the reaction with a low- molecular-weight compound, e.g., during the acetalization of poly(vinyl alcohol), in which hydroxy groups of neighboring crus undergo ring closure by reaction with the carbonyl group of an aldehyde (example 5.2)", "according to calculations by flory, the statistically maximum possible conversion of functional groups in such reactions is 86.5%", "this becomes understandable by considering the fact that, for statistical reasons, an isolated functional group cannot react in the desired way since there is no neighboring group", "these considerations are also true for polymers with several reactive groups in the fundamental building blocks or in branches", " oh oh oh oh oh  o  o  r  h  r  h  o  o  oh o  o  - h2o  hr  hr  the general considerations mentioned above can be summarized schematically  as follows:  when two low-molecular-weight materials a and b react with one another, a by-  product d is generally formed in addition to the desired product c:  a \u00fe b ! c \u00fe d  (5.1)  usually the reaction mixture also contains unreacted a and/or b", "to apply this general reaction scheme to the reaction of polymers, a must be regarded as the reactive group on the macromolecule m", "consequently, the reaction with reagent b yields group c (main product) and group d (by-product) that are likewise bound to the macromolecule by primary valencies; hence, in contrast to conversions of low-molecular-weight substances, c and d cannot be separated:  m\u00bd\u00f0a\u00fen() \u00fe b ! m\u00bd\u00f0a\u00fex () \u00f0c\u00fey () \u00f0d\u00fez()  (5.2)  where x + y + z \u00bc n", " depending on the structure and composition of the initial polymer (e.g., homo- polymer or copolymer), n can have any value between unity and the degree of polymerization; in the latter case each cru has a reactive group", "the number of groups a, c, and d in the reacted polymer are denoted x, y, and z, respectively", "it must be particularly emphasized that not all macromolecules in the product will contain the same number of these groups: x, y, and z are thus average values", "the situation x \u00bc z \u00bc 0 and y \u00bc n means that the desired reaction has gone to comple- tion, but this is rarely attained", " in certain cases also the chemical conversion of functional end groups e of  polymers or oligomers is of importance", "  5.1 chemical conversion of macromolecules  327  reactions with monofunctional reagents are for example carried out in order to increase the thermal and/or chemical stability of the end groups (polyoxymethylenes, example 5.7)", "reactions with bifunctional reagents can be used to enlarge the degree of polymerization or to synthesize block copolymers (see sect", "4.2.1)", " continuous reactions at the side chains of branched or comblike structured polymers play an important role in the solid-phase synthesis of peptides or oligo- nucleotides", " f  f  f  f  f'  f'  f'  f'  + b  here, besides the neighboring group participation along the chain, very often also the length of the spacer plays an important role for the reaction kinetics: if, for example, the reactive group f resides very far from the main chain due to the insertion of a flexible alkylene spacer -(-ch2-)n-, its pseudo-low-molecular- weight character increases intensely because of the higher mobility of the side chain in comparison to the less-mobile main chain", "in these cases deviations from the kinetic behavior of corresponding low-molecular-weight model compounds are hardly found", " in the above-mentioned example of the polymer-analogous saponification of poly (vinyl acetate) the reactant and the product differ in their properties, for example, in their solubility; however, both compounds have the same average degree of polymeri- zation", "the poly(vinyl alcohol) obtained by saponification can, in principle, be esterified back to poly(vinyl acetate) with the original molecular weight; the reacetylated polymer then has the same properties as the original material", "the viscosity number may be used to check whether in fact any chain scission has occurred during the reaction sequence of saponification and reacetylation (see example 5.1)", " before carrying out a specific conversion on a macromolecular substance, it is by all means expedient to first study the reaction of an appropriate low molecular model compound", "the substance chosen as a model should be similar to the cru in structure as well as in its reactive groups", "in the case of addition polymers, the corresponding monomer is not generally useable, since it contains a double bond that is not present in the polymer", "thus, rather than using monomeric styrene as a model compound for polystyrene one should take cumene, or esters of isopropyl alcohol for poly(vinyl ester)s and the corresponding derivative of trimethylacetic acid for polymethacrylates", "due to the fact that neighboring reactive groups of a macromolecular substance exert influence on each other, it is sometimes useful to chose dimers or trimers as model compounds, e.g., 2,4-pentanediol as a model for poly(vinyl alcohol), or the derivatives of pentanedioic acid, namely a-methylpen- tanedioic acid or 1,3,5-pentanetricarboxylic acid as models for derivatives of poly (acrylic acid)", "these model compounds are then used for preliminary experiments to determine optimal reaction conditions as well as the type of by-products to be expected", "thereby one simultaneously obtains model compounds for macromolec- ular reaction products", "these can then be used for dissolving tests and different analyses (e.g., determination of functional groups, comparison of nmr, ir, and   328  5 modification of macromolecular substances  uv spectra, phase transitions, pyrolysis gas chromatography, etc.)", "the information thus obtained, however, is not necessarily valid for conversions of polymers; this is especially true for the choice of solvent and reaction temperature as well as work-up and purification processes", " while reactions of low-molecular-weight compounds can sometimes be carried out in the gas phase, this technique is not applicable to macromolecular substances since they are not volatile", "however, it is indeed possible to let low-molecular reagents act upon solid or dissolved polymers in gaseous form", "this is done, for example, in the commercial preparation of methylcellulose by conversion of alkali cellulose with gaseous methyl chloride", " if the polymer can only be applied in a solid form because it is poorly soluble, or is insoluble due to crosslinking (as in the case of ion exchangers, see examples 5.9-5.10), or if the reaction is to take place only at the surface, it is convenient to work in dispersion of the finely divided polymer (for size reduction of polymers see sect", "2.5.1)", "therefore, the polymeric substance is suspended in an inert medium", "addition of a swelling agent is advantageous, because it lets the polymer swell superficially or throughout and thus favors access by the reagent", "in some cases the reagent itself can act as a swelling agent, such as, for example, in the acetylation of the semiacetal end groups of poly(oxymethylene)s (see example 5.7)", " if the reaction is carried out in a homogeneous phase one has to take into consideration the high viscosities, and hence the impairment of mass and heat exchange in polymer solutions", "for practical applications, this means that one must use strong and effective stirring units in order to obtain a good intermixing and to prevent local overheating", " when the low-molecular-weight reagent is liquid at the desired reaction temper- ature, and the polymer or the reaction product is soluble, sometimes no additional solvent must be used", "in this case the reagent is used in large excess and the polymeric reaction product is isolated in the usual way from the finally formed solution (see sect", "2.2.5.6)", "examples for this procedure are the conversions of cellulose (see examples 5.5 and 5.6) or polyacrolein", "whenever this procedure is not applicable, one has to use additional solvents", "the right solvent is chosen by finding one that dissolves the polymer, the reagent, and the catalyst (when needed)", "however, it must be remembered that during the course of the reaction the solubil- ity of the polymer may change quite sharply, even though only a small proportion of the reactive groups has been converted", "the polymer will then precipitate prema- turely, and thus hinder further conversion", "in this case, it is advisable to use a solvent in which the reaction product is soluble or to add this solvent gradually with progressing conversion", "should it not be possible to find a common solvent or mixture of solvents for both starting polymer and end product, it is preferable to perform the reaction in a medium which is a solvent for the reaction product", "starting from a dispersion of very finely divided polymer, the partially converted polymers will go into solution with advancing conversion and finally can react to completion in a homogeneous system", " also the reaction temperature has to be chosen with special care because, among others, this influences the ratio of main product to by-product decisively", "since with macromolecular substances it is principally not possible to separate the different   5.1 chemical conversion of macromolecules  329  reaction products within the polymer chain, the temperature should be chosen in such a way that primarily the main product will be formed, even though the reaction time may be prolonged by this choice", "lower temperatures are also advisable if crosslinking, thermal degradation, or chain scission by autoxidation (e.g., with polydienes) and hydrolysis (e.g., with cellulose) are to be anticipated", "such pro- cesses result in a substantial change of molecular weight and thus of the physical properties", "these possibilities have particularly to be considered if the conversion should be kept polymer-analogous: it might then be advantageous to work under a nitrogen atmosphere and/or to add an antioxidant", " in most cases, the recovery and purification procedures for the macromolecular product differ from those of the model compound, except for its separation from low-molecular-weight reagents and by-products; this is further discussed in sect", "2.2.5.7", " in order to assess the extent of reaction of a polymer, one cannot always apply the methods normally used to follow the reactions of low-molecular-weight compounds", "suitable methods for the characterization of polymers are therefore discussed in detail in sect", "2.3", " one may first check qualitatively whether the desired reaction has taken place, especially by means of solubility tests and nmr or ir spectroscopy", "it is also necessary to examine whether unreacted groups, or groups other than those desired, are present", "quantitative analysis is aimed at evaluating the proportions of a, c, and d in eq", "5.2, for which one may employ not only the usual methods of determi- nation, but also special procedures, such as spectroscopy and pyrolysis gas chromatography", "it is also sometimes expedient to choose the low-molecular- weight reactant so that an easily determinable element is introduced (e.g., by using chloroacetic acid for esterifications)", " the results of quantitative analysis can be presented in different ways", "the experimental value may be expressed as a weight percentage conversion, i.e., as grams of analytically determined crus per 100 g of polymer", "however, this method of expressing the conversion is not very informative since it does not indicate the extent to which the crus have been converted", "it is, therefore, better to state the conversion in mol%, i.e., to indicate how many crus per hundred have reacted in the appropriate manner", "it is then necessary to know the structure of any groups formed in side reactions, in order to calculate the molecular weight of all types of cru present in the polymer", "making the simplifying assumption that no side chain reactions have occurred, the reaction product can be regarded as a two- component system made up of unconverted groups a and product groups c", "the following

the work piece, for example, on films, coatings, or on molded rubber articles", "in addition to this, there is also the possibility of physical crosslinking, e.g., via hydrogen bonds as in case of polyamides or polyurethanes, which can be formed exclusively or in addition to covalent crosslinking", "another possibility is the crystalline domains of phase-separated block copolymers, composed of amorphous segments and segments that tend to crystallization", "when the polymers are stable enough, physical crosslinking is, in contrast to the covalent chemical crosslinking, thermally reversible and the materials can be processed thermoplastically", " network structures can be obtained directly through polyreactions using higher functional monomers, such as, e.g.,

is partially exuded from the shrunk gel", "for this teaching experiment it is not absolutely necessary to work under  nitrogen", " 5.2.1 polyelectrolytes from crosslinked macromolecules  5.2.1.1 ion exchanger a versatile application for crosslinked polymers is in ion exchangers", "ion exchangers are polyelectrolytes that generally consist of solid, crosslinked, and hence insoluble macromolecular compounds carrying acidic or basic groups on the macromolecular framework", "the long known inorganic, naturally occurring or synthetically prepared materials (e.g., zeolites and permutites, respectively) play today only a minor role as ion exchangers", "nowadays, most ion exchangers are made by subsequent introduction of ionic groups into crosslinked addition or condensation polymers (see example 5.9 and 5.10)", "thus, the usual ion exchangers are macromolecular, insoluble polyvalent acids or bases", "because of their insolu- bility they are well suited for the exchange of h+ or oh() ions", "thus, if an insoluble polyacid is suspended in water with a low-valent salt, the cations of the salt are exchanged with hydrogen ions (cation exchanger); correspondingly, the anions of a low-valent salt can be exchanged with hydroxy ions by using a basic anion exchanger", "this principle is applied, for example, in the preparation of pure water from sea water (desalination process)", "the processes which occur in these exchangers can be represented schematically as follows:  p  p  so3h  + na  nr3oh  + cl  p  p  so3na  + h  nr3cl  + oh  depending on the type of exchanger used, the acidic and basic groups may be contained in the same polymer, or the anionic and cationic exchangers can be mixed, or used in tandem", "the encircled \u201cp\u201d denotes the insoluble crosslinked resin with various exchangeable ions bound to its functional groups", " exchangers that have been loaded with cations or anions can be regenerated by treatment with acid or alkali, respectively, since one is always dealing with an equilibrium reaction", "commercially available ion exchangers are frequently   5.2 crosslinking of macromolecular substances  339  delivered in the form of salts so that before use they must be converted into the free acids or bases", "metal cations can also be directly exchanged with one another", " is common to start  the most suitable acidic groups for synthetic ion exchangers are sulfonic and carboxylic acid groups; phosphoric acid groups are less common", "for anion exchangers, primary, secondary, and tertiary amino groups are often used, also polymeric quaternary ammonium bases", "for the preparation of such ion exchangers it from a polymer", "copolymers of styrene and 1,4- divinylbenzene (see example 3.41) are especially useful for this purpose, which can be conveniently used in the form of polymer beads with a particle diameter of about 0.1-2 mm", "the content of 1,4-divinylbenzene in the monomer mixture used for polymerization determines the degree of crosslinking; it is generally indicated as wt% 1,4-divinylbenzene", "the higher the degree of crosslinking, the lower is the swellability of the polymer, however, the degree of swelling also depends on the nature of the counterion and on some other factors", "under certain conditions, for example, in the presence of organic solvents in bead polymerization, so-called macroreticular or macroporous networks are formed", "in this case the crosslinks are distributed irregularly over the whole volume of the material, unlike in normal networks", "this results in a porous structure combining the properties of high permeability for solvent and comparatively low swellability", "sometimes, such polymers have advantageous properties as starting materials for making ion exchangers", "the ionic functional groups are then introduced by chemical reactions", "one can also make ion exchangers by polymerizing monomers that already contain functional groups", "thus, methacrylic acid can be polymerized in the presence of small amounts of a crosslinker to give a weak cation exchanger", " another possibility which is used commercially is to prepare insoluble conden- sation polymers, e.g., from phenol and formaldehyde, into which ionic groups are subsequently introduced", " ion exchangers can also be made from cellulose, especially for scientific applications", "they are prepared from alkali cellulose by reaction, for example, with chloroacetic acid (for preparation of sodium carboxymethylcellulose, see example 5.6)", "by conversion with 2-chloroethyldiethylamine one obtains

ion exchanger is its capacity", "this denotes the number of equivalents of exchangeable counterions on a high polymer network, with respect either to the weight or volume of dry or swollen exchanger", "for laboratory use the capacity is usually expressed in meq/g; for the softening of hard water the usable exchange capacity is often given in g of cao/l of exchanger", " various procedures can be applied to effect ion exchange", "the simplest method is to work batchwise whereby the exchanger is left in contact with a solution of the ions to be exchanged until equilibrium is reached", "this method is applicable to those exchange reactions where the equilibrium is in favor of the desired product; this can of course always be achieved by employing a sufficient excess of a cation exchanger in its acidic form to a metal salt solution", "  340  5 modification of macromolecular substances  however, ion exchange is mostly carried out using columns", "as in column chromatography, the solution to be exchanged is allowed to run through the column of ion exchanger from top to bottom", "the ion exchanger used to fill the column must already be in the swollen state before it is washed into the column, otherwise the pressure caused by swelling may lead to bursting of the glass tube", " ion exchangers are not only used commercially (e.g., for water softening, recovery of metals from waste water, refining of raw sugar), but also to an increasing extent in the laboratory", "thus, ion exchangers provide a convenient and clean way of preparing free acids or bases (e.g., free thiocyanic acid by exchange of ammonium thiocyanate with an acid cation exchanger) or of purifying aqueous solutions (e.g., removal of formic acid from solutions of formaldehyde)", "ion exchangers can also be used to catalyze chemical conversions, being readily removed by filtration after the required reaction has occurred", "examples of this type are esterifications or protein hydrolyses catalyzed by acid ion exchangers", "by introducing complex-forming groups into crosslinked polymers, numerous exchangers have also been prepared which allow selective extraction of certain metals from solution or provide a means of enrichment of elements that are present in low concentration", "the synthetic routes for this purpose are indeed very complicated, for example, the aromatic amino group of crosslinked poly(aminostyrene-co-styrene) can be diazotized and then coupled with suitable phenol derivatives, or, by using formaldehyde 8-quinolinol, can be bound covalently to acrylamide-containing

improved by blocking these end groups [see example 5.13, thermal depolymerization of polyoxymethylene]", " the kind of fragments formed on degradation depends mainly on the structure of the polymer

emission of light (radiant relaxation, often termed as \u201celectro-luminescence\u201d)", "such electro-luminescence is possible without restrictions if a singlet exciton is formed: in this case,

possible to offer alternative pathways to the radiant triplet relaxation: introduction of so-called triplet emitters, which open pathways for radiant relaxation with spin-inversion, help increasing

functional polymers showing modulated electrical conductivity depending on external parameters: the material is electrically insulating in the absence of light since no free charge carriers are

"xerography and laser printing technologies", " in essentially all cases mentioned above the constitution of the polymers itself is responsible for the fact that the material is able to convert into an electrically semi- conducting (and sometimes conducting) state", "therefore, they are called intrinsi- cally conducting polymers", "this specification is applied to differentiate them from e.g", "polymer-based composite materials, which develop electrical (and maybe thermal) conductivity just because of the presence of conducting fillers, which are dispersed appropriately in the otherwise non-conducting polymer matrix", "one promising strategy in this respect is to add carbon-based (preferentially nano- scalic) fillers such as carbon black, carbon nano-tubes or graphenes into the insulating bulk polymer, and to process the composite subsequently in a fashion that allows the filler particles to develop a so-called percolation network through the whole material (fig", "6.9)", "these percolation paths represent the highways for the charge carriers", "if very high degrees of filling are realized and the processing is perfectly adapted, even heat transport can be observed through these composites", "the latter option is expected to be of benefit for electro-mobility, heat management of batteries, bipolar plates of fuel cells, and cooler units of computer processors", "

electronic devices", "based on closely related concepts, it is also possible to increase the refractive index of a transparent polymer: when mixed with nano-scale particles of high refractive indices such as titanium dioxide or zirconium dioxide, a composite material may result, which shows higher refractive indices than the pure polymer", "application of the materials as optical lenses is one option - if aggregation of the filler nano-particles can be prevented reliably (fig", "6.9)", " finally, it should be mentioned that, in addition to the above examples, many further aspects may be encountered why and where functional polymers can be applied in combination with light and/or electrical power", "for example, shape- anisotropy of polymers can cause the formation of lyotropic and/or thermotropic mesophases (liquid-crystalline polymers, lcps)", "alike, small-molecule mesogens, lcps undergo specific interactions with light depending on the type and extent of mesoscalic order in the liquid-crystalline state", "since many semi-conducting polymers are rod like in shape (and thus anisotropic), not only modulated conduc- tivity and emission can be observed depending on the respective structure, but even special effects such as emission of polarized light when applied in oleds", " another topic related with p-electron conjugation in functional polymers is their nonlinear optical (nlo) behavior: such materials can be used to convert red light into light of shorter wavelength by frequency doubling or tripling", "one advantage offered by shorter wavelengths is the higher capacity for processing and storage of information and optical computing", "moreover, these materials are of interest for photonic devices like optical switches, modulators and waveguides", "high
