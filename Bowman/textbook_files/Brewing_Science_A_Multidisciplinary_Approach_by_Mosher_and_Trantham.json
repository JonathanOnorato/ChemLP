  preface  to the student  what do your professors do at the end of a day at college? many, the authors included, will enjoy a craft brew and discuss the day\u2019s successes and opportunities for improvement", "thus began the discussion for the beginnings of this book", "\u201cwouldn\u2019t it be awesome,\u201d we thought, \u201cif we could highlight the science that goes into brewing? the students would just love a brewing science class!\u201d we spent the next weeks and months designing and planning a course that would illustrate the interdisciplinary nature of brewing science", " the result is what you will find here", "this text represents the topics that are taught in our courses on an introduction to brewing", "these courses are very popular at our institutions and attended by students from almost every major", "we have tried to write from your perspective and provide not only the processes that you will encounter in the brewery, but also provide the reasons why those processes are completed and the science behind them", "and we have written the text with no assumptions as to what courses you have previously taken", "as topics are intro- duced, we also introduce the science behind them starting from the basics", "as we have found, teaching \u201cjust in time\u201d provides useful examples for you to use to help you understand the background and the topic in question", " every few pages, you will find checkpoint boxes", "these are designed to provide you with a chance to take a break and confirm that you have gathered the key topics of the discussion to that point", "this is also how we have constructed the images that accompany the discussion", "when images and tables appear in the text, it is important to take a break from reading and examine them in detail", "understand why each is included in the chapter, and why each is presented in the way it is", "(some professors, the authors included, find great quiz and test questions by looking at the figures.)  we sincerely hope that you enjoy your studies of this exciting topic", "one thing you will note from the start, brewing science requires an understanding of a nearly endless range of topics from biology to chemistry to physics to history to almost every subject taught on campus", "the purpose of the book is not to make you, the student, a physical chemist or a fluids engineer, but it will give you a sense of what is possible in the brewery", "and, it will provide you with an understanding behind  v   vi  preface  why things are done the way that they are in the brewery", "brewing science can be very technical, but our hope is that you find the subject just as fascinating as we do", " to the instructor  the first incarnation of the course described by the topics in this text was directed at the general studies level", "the science discussed in that type of course is descriptive and general in nature", "we found that the class attracted a wide range of majors with varying interest levels", "this class is still taught at the university of nebraska kearney", "however, we have found that the class also attracted those with more than a passing interest in brewing and wanted to dive deeper into the rich science that surrounds the craft brewing industry", "so, we have included the detail that is appropriate for those courses that do this, such as the course taught at the university of northern colorado", " this text is written from a process-centric approach to uncovering the principles behind brewing science", "instead of a discussion of brewing from the perspective of the four main ingredients (water, malt, hops, and yeast), this text is formatted and written from the viewpoint of the steps taken to manufacture beer (malting, milling, mashing, boiling, etc.)", "the topics are focused more on the technical aspects and design principles of brewing", "as the students uncover the process of mashing, they explore the background chemistry needed to fully develop their understanding", "as we explore wort chilling, we dive into the background in thermodynamics that explains this process", "thus students learn what they need to know as they need to know it", "we have found this process of \u201cjust in time\u201d teaching to be very effective", "it produces opportunities to introduce examples, increase motivation, and set high bars for achievement", " we hope, as well, that this text will provide you, the instructor, with the greater detail needed behind each of the processes in the brewery and the insight into the interrelationships between topics in brewing science", "we realize that there are parts of the book that may be mathematically challenging to a general audience", "but, the language of science is mathematics-and with practice and motivation to be suc- cessful, the general audience can succeed", " within each chapter are checkpoint questions that provide key questions that students should be able to accomplish by studying the material preceding them", "at the end of each chapter are questions that expand upon these in-chapter ques- tions", "the summary section at the end of the chapter is also helpful in directing students as they move through the text", " finally, each chapter contains at least one laboratory experiment that can help explain the material in the chapter", "both of the author\u2019s courses in this subject have related laboratories that we have noted are extremely useful in developing student interest and motivation and providing confirmation of topics in the course", "addi- tional \u201claboratory experiments\u201d can be obtained by modifying the laboratory tests found in the american society of brewing chemists methods of analysis resource", "  preface  vii  it is our sincere hope that you, the instructor, find the information in this text to be helpful to you and your students irrespective of the level of your introductory course in brewing science", "as a standalone text, or used in conjunction with handouts and additional readings, the material inside should be helpful to your students", "whether they are beginning their studies for a diploma in brewing from the institute of brewing and distilling, satisfying a general studies requirement, or reading for interest, the student is sure to find interest in this topic", " greeley, usa

know a lot about the process and the product that they make", "in most cases, they have spent a considerable number of years at their craft, experi- menting with different malts and grains, different yeasts, and different processes until they have arrived at what they consider to be the perfect beer", "any courses or training that the master brewer takes is extremely rigorous, often involving multiple months or years of intensive study and potentially even an apprenticeship under an experienced master brewer", "those years of training to master the art of brewing beer require not only mastery of the processes and recipes, but also an under- standing of how the science behind the process results in a particular flavor or product profile", " many brewers would agree that knowing the science of brewing is important to the process of brewing beer", "not only does the science govern how hop oils protect beer from minor spoilage or how barley must be sprouted before it can be used to make beer, but the general principles used to practice science guide the brewer everyday", "what principle helps a brewer make everyday decisions?  1.1.1 the scientific method  the scientific method is a process of thinking about problems", "the method is outlined in fig", "1.1", "brewers, or anyone for that matter, that use this process methodically arrive at the answer to a problem or develop a law or theory based on observations", "this is the same way of thinking about the world around us that scientists use everyday", "an example helps guide us to understanding the scientific method", " a

"for example, the brewer may hypothesize that the temperature of the water used in the process was too hot", "then, the brewer would perform an experiment to try to eliminate that flavor, in this case by reducing the temperature in the next batch of beer", "after making more obser- vations (tasting the beer, running laboratory analysis of flavor components, etc.), the brewer would then compare those results to the original hypothesis", "if the obser- vations did not fit the original hypothesis, the brewer would modify the hypothesis and return to the brewery to perform another experiment", "then, they would modify or recreate the hypothesis and test it out in the brewery", "this cyclical process would continue until the hypothesis did not need modification after repeated experiments", "the brewer would have found the answer to the observation and know what to do if that situation ever arose again", "when the hypothesis is proved in such a manner, it can be called a law or a theory", " a law is a tested and proven hypothesis that explains the initial problem", "laws do not explain why the problem occurs, but simply what happens if another thing is done", "in our previous example, the brewer may eventually discover that if the serving tap for the beer was cleaned immediately before use, the off-flavor would disappear and arrive at a law: cleaning the beer tap removes the buttered popcorn flavor in the beer", " a theory, on the other hand, is a tested and proven hypothesis that explains why something happens", "theories are the most definitive statements that can be made", "they are not just statements that identify the outcome of a particular step in the brewery", "they predict the outcome by providing a detailed explanation of why that outcome occurs at any level of observation", "to a brewer, and any scientist, a theory is the best statement that one can have about a process", "in our example, the brewer may develop a theory that explains that bacteria

beer?  the word \u201cbeer\u201d has many possible origins", "most likely this word derives from the middle english word bere or from the old english word b\u0113or", "the old high german word bior may also be the precursor, as could the middle dutch word b\u0113r", "as we can see, the word \u201cbeer\u201d has roots from europe at least as early as the middle ages (fifth to fifteenth century)", "the words from that time that gave us \u201cbeer\u201d referred to a fermented drink made from malted cereals and flavored with a myriad of different ingredients", "in some cases, roots or other starchy plant materials instead of cereal grains were used to make the drink", " it is clear that beer is vastly different from wine", "beer is brewed, and wine is not", "brewing is the process of converting starches into fermentable sugars", "in other words, the starch in grains or other materials is converted into sugars, and then, those sugars are fermented into an alcoholic beverage", "because fermentable sugars already exist in fruit, a beverage made by adding yeast to fruits is not brewed, but still results in an alcoholic beverage we know as wine", "while both wine and beer are alcoholic drinks, making beer requires a few more steps", " the people in the early years of brewing did not use the same recipe to make beer", "one group of people used recipes that vastly differed from other groups", "some used malted barley; others used roots, wheat, rice, and other grains to create the beverage", "flavoring agents added to the drink were equally as varied in those early days and in many cases absent from the finished product", "moreover, the alcohol content in beer was varied", "some early beers (and some beers that are still found today) had very little alcohol content, while others were quite potent", "it all depended upon the process, the availability of ingredients, and the tastes of the peoples that made the drink", "the first recorded recipe the first beers were most likely made in mesopotamia, the cradle of civilization, well before the eighteenth century bc", "we know this because references to beer parlors were noted in the code of hammurabi", "this code   4  1 introduction to brewing science  of laws was written around 1772 bc by the sixth babylonian king, hammurabi", "the code explained the laws for the operation of their civilization; the phrase we know as \u201can eye for an eye\u201d comes from these laws", "beer was noted in many places within the laws as well, hinting that beer predated this time enough to have per- vaded society by 1772 bc", " specifically written in the code were severe penalties for beer parlor owners who overcharged for their product", "they were to be drowned as punishment", "this is harsh punishment to be sure, but most likely necessary to stop brewers from gouging their customers", "the laws even noted that high priestesses were to be executed by fire if they were caught in establishments that served beer", "while priestesses often drank and used beer in religious ceremony, they were not allowed to do so in a bar", "this indicates that a separation between the religious uses of beer and the common consumption of beer was desired in their society", " other evidence of beer is also found in this region of the world", "ninkasi, a deity worshipped by the sumerians, was known as the goddess of beer", "archaeologists uncovered a tablet written in cuneiform dating from about 1800 bc that outlines just how important ninkasi was to her worshippers", "the hymn to ninkasi, either chanted or sung to a tune that was not written down, details how to make beer", "most likely the hymn was created as a way for the average citizen to remember the recipe, because only highly skilled people could write during those times", "it is clear that the beer made by the recipe was used not only for religious rituals, but also served as a staple for the average citizen", "the second verse of the hymn explains this use:  may ninkasi live together with you! let her pour for you beer [and] wine,  while i feel wonderful, i feel wonderful, drinking beer, in a blissful mood", " the recipe described in the hymn refers to the preparation of a loaf of bread made from malted barley", "the bread was to then be soaked in water and allowed to ferment", "the resulting mixture, with the sort of a soft oatmeal-soup-like consis- tency, was then poured into vessels to be consumed", "this differs greatly from today\u2019s brewing process, but still results in a drinkable beer if you do not mind drinking soggy bread-beer", " early beer in other regions of the world clay tablets dating from 2500 bc confirm that the sumerians were producing beer in cities across their domain", "a specific tablet was found that appears to be a receipt for an order of beer from the city of ebla", "evidence exists that beer was likely a staple long before even these writings were made", "in the same region of the world, tombs and figurines from ancient egypt illustrated beer making and drinking (fig", "1.2)", "these reliefs and figurines date to about the same time as the sumerians were enjoying the fruits of their labors", "interestingly, the sumerians and egyptians made their beer almost the same as it was described in the hymn to ninkasi", "  1.2 what is beer?  5  fig", "1.2 egyptian

"evidence exists from some archaeological sites that this drink was produced as early as 7000 bc from a mixture of rice, honey, and fruits", "the evidence takes the form of residues found on pottery excavated from ancient sites", "the rice used in this process was most likely germinated before brewing or chewed by the brewer to promote the release of starches and their conversion into fermentable sugars", "while no text has yet been found that describes the process or provides a recipe that was used, it is clear that the ancient peoples of china enjoyed beer", " as time progressed, a number of different recipes for making beer were devel- oped", "in fact, records from early greek historians indicate that there were over a dozen different types of drinks that we might call beer", "and as the drink moved north out of africa and mesopotamia, that variability continued to grow", "the different recipes used to make beer resulted in a similar variability in the number of words that refer to the beverage", "for example, the sumerians called it \u201cka.\u201d the egyptians called it \u201cbouza.\u201d even within a culture there were multiple names for the beverage, most likely because of many different recipes or reflecting different uses of the beer", "in fact, the egyptians referred to seventeen different types of beer, including one known as \u201cjoy bringer\u201d and another known as \u201cheavenly.\u201d the ancient babylonians called the beverage \u201csikra.\u201d  these early beers differ greatly from the beers we find in the stores today", "we currently recognize the beverage as a product made from malted grains (typically barley) and hops and fermented to provide an alcoholic drink with varying degrees   6  1 introduction to brewing science  of bitter flavor", "the ancient beers, from what evidence can be found, were likely very malty, bready, and in some cases sweet or dry depending upon the addition of fruits and their type", "it is very evident that there was little, if any, bitterness to them", "the development of beer from the early fermented bread-water mixture to that of today is a long and storied history that we will explore later in this chapter", " checkpoint 1.2 a brewer makes an alcoholic drink from yams", "is this a beer or a wine? why? why was beer not made with the same ingredients in different places of the world?  1.3 some common conventions  in our studies of beer, we have to make sure that we can communicate with other brewers, malt and hop suppliers, yeast producers, customers, and tax enforcement officials correctly and accurately", "to do so, a series of conventions have been established that help us in our conversations", "these conventions ensure uniformity in reporting the values associated with volume, temperature, and weight measurements", "unfortunately, this uniformity did not always exist", "in the early years of brewing, descriptions of the amount of grain, the amount of water, and the amount of added fruits or herbs were akin to a trade secret", "the brewer had a serious problem", "how do you tell someone how to make beer but avoid using words such as kilogram, pound, or gallon? so recipes, if they existed, were developed using whatever measuring device was available", "for example, if a certain amount of malt was to be added to the mashing vessel, the quantity might be described as equivalent to the weight of a person, or the same as would be used to make a dozen loafs of bread", "it is easy to see that without a standard to compare, recipes were difficult to follow and very rarely was the same flavor of beer replicated", " the issue in reporting specific values lies within three main categories", "an accurate recipe must be able to provide the brewer with ways to measure the volume, the temperature, and the mass of the ingredients", "while the initial measurements might be done using reference to known things, once a standard was developed, the recipes were able to be accurately reproduced", " 1.3.1 volume  the volume of a liquid is the space that it occupies", "that space in the usa is often referenced in terms of the number of fluid ounces, cups, gallons, quarts, etc", "in the scientific world, volumes are referenced in terms of the dimensions of a cube that could hold the liquid", "reporting the volume in scientific terms means knowing the   1.3 some common conventions  7  dimensions of the cube and describing it using the distances on each side", "for example, a cube that is 2.0 in", "by 2.0 in", "by 2.0 in", "is said to be 8.0 in.3 or 8.0 in.3", " 2:0 in: () 2:0 in: () 2:0 in: \u00bc 8:0 in:3  in the scientific world, a set of standards is used rather universally", "those standards are referred to as the syst\u00e8me international d\u2019unites (in english, the international system of units, or si system)", "distances in si units are recorded using base units of meters", "a meter is slightly more than the us yard, so the volume described by a cubic meter is a very large measurement", "for example, in the usa, we still order concrete using the units of cubic yards (a volume of concrete that is 3 ft by 3 ft by 3 ft)", "to reduce this down to something more manageable, scientists often talk about volumes in terms of liters", "a liter is the volume represented by a cube that is one tenth of a meter on each side (0.1 m by 0.1 m by 0.1 m) and is close to the same size as the us quart", " the use of si units outside of the usa is very common", "brewers use liters to describe the volume of beer that they produce, or more accurately, brewers describe the volume of beer that they produce in units of hectoliters, where 1 hl is equiv- alent to 100 l", "but in the usa, volumes are still reported using gallons and many of the older english measurements such as quarts, pints, and tuns", "these were originally determined based on the different sizes of casks and other containers that were used to hold beer", "some of these units may seem foreign, but knowing them can be very helpful", " we can still measure the volume using a ruler and multiplying to get the number of cubic inches", "all that is necessary at that point, then, is to convert the number of cubic inches into gallons or barrels or whatever other unit we wish to know", "table 1.1 lists some common volumes of beer and their relationship to the number of equivalent cubic inches and us gallons", "the number of cubic inches is supplied in the table to aid in conversion from one unit to another and to show just how large some of the measurements of volume can be", " it is important to note that the volume measurements outlined in table 1.1 are specific to beer or ale", "believe it or not, if we talked about a different liquid or even a solid material like flour, our volume measurements would be completely different", "what is very apparent is that there are a lot of different volume measurements for beer", "and from the note to the table, volume measurements for beer were redefined a few times as time passed", "moreover, we can see that the current names for many of these units have been used for quite some time to relate quantities of beer", " there is more than one volume measurement known as a barrel", "the two most common for beer are indicated in table 1.1, but there are a lot of other definitions for the barrel (and the volume actually depends upon what you are measuring)", "the myriad of volume measurements is due to the long history of beer; different countries used different sized barrels to measure their liquids based on their own customs and how things were taxed", "standardization of some units, in fact, did not occur until recently", "  100 l 4 quarts 2 pints, 64 oz (us)  2 pins 2 firkins 2 kilderkins 0.5

the amount of heat, or thermal energy, contained by a substance", "things that are hot are said to have a large amount of this energy, and things that are cold have less", "when something has no thermal energy at all, it has the coldest temperature possible", "this is known as absolute zero", "at the other end of the scale, however, there is essentially no upper limit", "we will explore heat in much greater detail in chap", "8", " the brewer prior to the invention of the thermometer definitely needed to know how much thermal energy was present during the brewing process", "recipes dating from the seventeenth century (prior to the use of the thermometer in brewing) often refer to an ingenious way to obtain a somewhat reproducible temperature for mashing", "in that method, water was heated to boiling and then allowed to cool slowly", "when the brewer could see his face in the liquid through the steam, it was deemed to be at the right temperature", "this often resulted in a temperature very near to 150-160 \u00b0f, almost the perfect temperature needed for mashing malt", " in the early days of the development of science as a discipline, fascination with temperature was common among practitioners", "each was interested in devising an instrument to measure temperatures in the most accurate and practical method possible", "in fact, there are at least 52 different thermometers that were invented", "while most of these are no longer used today, a couple of them are used very heavily across the world", " scientists, as we noted before, tend to prefer units and measurements that are outlined in the si unit definitions", "for temperature, this includes the use of the units in celsius (\u00b0c), named after anders celsius (1701-1744), and kelvin (k), named after william thompson, baron kelvin (1824-1907)", "the celsius scale places the temperature at which water freezes at 0 \u00b0c and the temperature at which water boils at 100 \u00b0c", "the kelvin

below the freezing point to the boiling point of water", "the freezing point is simply the temperature at which a liquid becomes a solid", "the boiling point, on the other hand, is the tem- perature where the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the pressure of the atmosphere", " as the temperature of any liquid increases, the amount of vapor above that liquid also increases", "for example, when we heat a pot of water on the stove, the amount of steam above the liquid increases as the water gets hotter", "when the pressure of that steam is equal to the pressure of the environment, the water is said to be boiling", "note that the boiling point is not the temperature where we see bubbles forming in the liquid", "that temperature is close to, but not the same as the boiling point of the liquid", "in fact, the bubbles we do see are actually steam (not bubbles of air) where locally, and the water is hot enough to boil, but the entire pot of water has not reached the same boiling temperature yet", " as we increase our altitude where we perform our boiling water experiment, the temperature of the boiling water drops", "at sea level, boiling water occurs when the temperature is 212 \u00b0f (100 \u00b0c)", "in denver, colorado, a mile higher into the atmosphere than at sea level, the boiling point of water occurs near 202 \u00b0f (94 \u00b0c)", "this occurs because the atmosphere is thinner in denver; the pressure of the atmosphere in denver is less than the pressure at sea level", "therefore, we do not have to heat the water as hot to get the pressure of the steam to equal the pressure of the atmosphere", "it may save some energy to heat our water to boiling at a higher elevation, but the decreased temperature also results in a lower temperature of the boiling process in brewing beer", "this decreased temperature means that we may have to boil the water longer in order to have certain chemical changes occur in the beer that we desire", " this is immediately apparent if we look at the back of a box of cake mix", "there is often a special set of directions that help account for the decreased boiling points of water at higher altitudes", "usually, a small amount of additional water is added to account for the increased evaporation at the higher altitude", "table 1.2 provides the boiling point of water at a series of selected cities across the world", "

little tipsy, the early brewers slowly began to realize that beer did not spoil as quickly as other beverages (such as milk, juice, or even water)", "milk, for example, spoiled in warm climates very quickly after it was obtained and had to be consumed soon or it would go sour", "beer, on the other hand, did not appear to show a deterioration in its flavor as quickly and so it could be kept for a little while after it was made", "in some cases, it likely tasted better when it was a little old", " the early brewers did not understand what gave drinkers the feeling of euphoria or allowed the beer to be kept for a while before consumption", "today, we know that the small amount of ethyl alcohol (also known as ethanol, grain alcohol, or simply alcohol) produced in the beer during the brewing process is the reason for these effects", "some beers possess quantities of alcohol that are <1 % of the total volume, and others can be 10, 20, 30 % or more alcohol by volume", "while the

with water, heating the soup to cook and distribute the ingredients evenly, and then cooling it", "wild yeasts and bacteria in the air or living in the pottery or wooden spoons used to stir the mixture would grow quickly in the cool mixture, and fermentation would result", "after few days, the fermentation would have slowed dramatically and the beer would have been con- sumed", "the mixture

additives were poured in a vessel and heated slowly to boiling", "the slow increase in the temperature converted the starches into sugars, and boiling helped to thin the mixture and clarify it", "the

ship\u2019s master christopher jones, became concerned about the supplies on board, especially the supplies of beer and grog", "most likely it was he who convinced john carver to identify a suitable site for their settlement as quickly as possible", "as one of the settler\u2019s wrote in their diary:  we could not now take time for further search of consideration, our victuals being much spent, especially our beere", " a suitable site for the colony was found in present-day massachusetts, but by the time the colonists were off-loaded, it was too late in the season for the mayflower to return to england", "so, while the settlers of the plymouth colony spent the brutal   1.6 history of beer in the usa  23  winter of 1620-1621 on dry land, the crew of the mayflower stayed on the ship to guard their beer supply for the trek back to england planned for the following spring", "there are many accounts of pilgrims begging for supplies from the ship\u2019s stores that were only, albeit begrudgingly, supplied to those settlers who were ill", "all across the east coast of the new world settlements were started", "while some settlements in the south imported their beer from europe, the majority of the colonies set about building a brewery as one of the first buildings in their new villages", "in fact, the earliest help wanted advertisement in the new world was in 1609 for a brewer", "the supplies brought over to start the brewery in the new settlements often contained both barley seed for growing a new crop and bags of malted and raw barley for use in making beer immediately", "to be sure, the stockpile would not last long", "new barley would have to be grown and malted quickly", " in many settlements along the coast, the european barley strains would not grow well", "supplements and even replacements for the barley were needed", "wheat, rye, oats, and other grains were chosen for the purpose", "those immigrants that befriended native tribes learned to use corn as a replacement for barley", "in fact, the natives in the new world had been making their own version of beer using corn and other ingredients for centuries", "their knowledge coupled with the immigrant\u2019s skill in making beer resulted in a beverage that was said to be better than an english ale", "this could have been optimism, but it was clear that the production and consumption of beer were so important that the colonists would try anything", " the first formal brewery in the new world was established in 1612 in new amsterdam (later to become new york city), roughly 8 years before the pilgrims began their voyage", "had the mayflower found its way to the hudson, the pilgrims and crew of the ship would have been close enough to access this brewery immediately", "as it was, the pilgrims followed suit with many of the other settle- ments and built their own brewery", " evidence of the importance of brewing in the new world is clear", "for example, in 1640, a law was passed in the massachusetts colony stating that no one should be allowed to brew beer unless he is a good brewer", "other laws were enacted to ensure the quality of beer", "in 1655, in the new york colony, a law required brewers to have sufficient skill and knowledge in the art and \u201cmystery\u201d of brewing if they planned to sell their beer", "obviously, at least one person was not a fan of the beer produced in the brewery at the time", " as the settlements grew, brewing followed", "the task was still accomplished in the home for those that had the ingredients and time, or could afford to make the beer the way they liked it", "in settlements without a communal brewhouse, families grew or bartered for the ingredients to make beer", "trade and traveling from town to town was also common and that led to the development of taverns across the colonies", "taverns often had a communal room to serve meals and beer and bed- rooms or bunkrooms for those that stayed the night", "the first recorded tavern was licensed to samuel cole in 1634 in present-day boston", "these places served as restaurants, hotels, and gathering places where the locals would obtain the day\u2019s

independence over a 3-day period at his usual table in the indian queen head tavern in philadelphia", " taverns also served a major role in the american revolution", "when a state would \u201ccall up\u201d a militia, the commander of the militia would usually buy a barrel or two of beer at a local tavern and give away the beer to anyone that showed up", "able-bodied men from all around would appear for their free beer or two (or three) and join the militia", "george washington, a skilled brewer at home, quickly learned the power of the tavern", "as a young lieutenant in the continental army, he found out that supplying beer to the polling places dramatically increased one\u2019s chances of being elected to office", "later, in his role as general, he insisted that his troops received a quart of beer each day", "during that fateful winter at valley forge, he decreed that the troops received their daily ration of drink before the officers", "as america entered the nineteenth century, small breweries became common- place", "brewing was still done in the home, but the time-consuming nature of the process meant that there was a place for the brewery", "these breweries produced their beer primarily for local use, storing the beer in casks until it was consumed", "by 1810, there were 140 commercial breweries in the usa", "production was not very large for these breweries, and most of the business was local, but those breweries that were successful did quite well", "vassar college, for example, was founded from the profits earned by brewer matthew vassar in 1860", " while some growth in the industry happened in the early 1800s, large growth in the industry was not really observed until the decades after the end of the civil war", "the first federal tax on beer production was imposed in 1862 to help offset the costs of the us civil war", "after the war had ended, the incidences of heavy drinking,   1.6 history of beer in the usa  25  however, increased", "the war had been very traumatic on everyone in the country, and for many, solace was found in overindulgence of alcohol", "advocates for less alcoholic alternatives to \u201chard\u201d liquor became more and more vocal", " in addition, as immigrants from germany began coming to the usa, their taste for lagers over ales helped fuel the increase in beer production and the development of more and more breweries that specialized in this style of beer", "with the invention of artificial refrigeration, the mass production of beer and transportation to different parts of the country became commonplace", "annual production of beer in the usa rose from 3.7 million barrels in 1865 to 39.5 million barrels by 1900", "the dramatic increase in production meant that beer was available year-round in nearly every part of the country", "this resulted in a similar increase in the per capita consumption to nearly 16 gallons per person per year", " the worldwide interest in temperance, or restraint from the consumption of alcohol, became a movement in the usa in the 1800s", "as early as the 1820s and 1830s, organizations were formed that promoted abstinence from alcohol as a way of life", "these organizations were fueled by the increasing abuse of distilled bev- erages and were linked to social behaviors that were deemed inappropriate or illegal", "while it was suggested that beer was better than liquor because it was less intoxicating, every alcoholic drink quickly became included in the temperance movement", "and the movement took on abstinence as forcefully as it could", "in 1851, maine was the first state to outlaw the sale of alcoholic beverages", "by 1855, twelve states had adopted similar \u201cmaine laws\u201d making it illegal to sell beer", "unfortu- nately for the movement, a riot in maine overperceived access to beer in 1856 resulted in repealing the law in that state", "the temperance movement stalled in the second half of the 1800s in the usa due to many different factors", "recognition of a need to tackle more important issues such as emancipation and women\u2019s suffrage pushed the ideals of national abstinence to the back burner", " however, growing anti-german sentiment in the usa during and after world war i empowered the temperance movement in the usa", "because families of german decent operated many of the larger breweries in the country, the link to abstinence was fueled", "the anti-saloon league (founded by howard hyde rus- sell) used its political power to sway the federal legislature and enact a mandate against alcohol", "in 1917, the united states congress passed the 18th amendment to the us constitution", "thirty-six of the 48 states had ratified the amendment by the end of 1919", "the law implementing the amendment, the volstead act, went into effect on january 17, 1920", "it outlawed the \u201cmanufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages in the usa and its possessions.\u201d overnight, the future of alcoholic beverages in the usa changed", " many of the small breweries closed shop and sold off their equipment to anyone that was interested", "some just closed their doors and waited, hoping that prohibition would not last", "others retooled themselves and produced non-alcoholic beer, soda, root beer, and even ice cream", "when prohibition was repealed in 1933, and states again allowed the sale of beer (the last to allow beer to be sold was kansas in 1937, although some counties in the usa still outlaw the sale of beer), beer production began in earnest", "initially, only beer containing 3.2 % alcohol or less by volume   26  1 introduction to brewing science  was approved for sale", "this worked well for the breweries in that less malt was required to make such a beer", "in addition, the initial shortage of malt as the breweries came back online meant that other adjuncts would need to be used", "thus, rice and corn use in the manufacture of beer in the usa entered the scene en force", "the breweries that weathered the years from 1919 to 1933 produced vast quantities of lager style beer for the thirsty american public", "immediately, the number of breweries increased as there was a seemingly endless market for beer", "unfortunately, the initial rush to produce beer in quantity was immediately fol- lowed by world war ii", "rationing of malt and other staples during the 1940s meant that the adjuncts initially used to help the breweries get by until malt production increased were to become an integral part of the standard recipe", "the continued production of the american lager meant that the average us citizen learned to love and accept this as the only possible flavor of beer", "afterall, many beer drinkers in the 1940s and beyond had only this style available their entire life", "after world war ii, the production of the american lager continued with vigor", "and until the 1980s, there was very little else in the way of

(such as competitions between homebrew clubs or for the best brew in the mountains), or even national (such as the great american beer festival\u2122)", "the contestants take these competitions very seriously", "much like the bbq cook-offs outlined on tv, care is taken by the brewers to make sure that they have done the best job possible", "not only can cash prizes be awarded, but also any medal itself is highly coveted and proudly displayed by the brewer", " each of these competitions requires that the brewer submit a couple of bottles of beer, properly labeled, and including the particular category to judge the beer under", "because there are only so many spots open in each competition, failure to submit the samples properly is often grounds for elimination from the judging", "once the samples have been accepted, the brewer just has to wait as the judges meet, taste, and evaluate each of the beers", " the results, when they finally arrive, outline the beer in terms of its appearance, aroma, and taste", "this information can be very helpful to the brewer", "it can be used to provide feedback on the quality of the beer as it conforms to the judge\u2019s per- ception of it", "for example, it may have a buttery flavor and knowing that the flavor exists may be of assistance to the brewer in tuning the flavors for future batches", "the beer may be unusually bubbly, indicating to the brewer some information about the packaging process", " judges for a brewing competition can have a wide variety of experience", "in some competitions, no experience is required", "in others, at least one, if not all, of the judges on each tasting panel are required to have some formal training in judging beer flavors", "programs that can provide that training exist and include the beer judge certification program (bjcp; https://www.bjcp.org)", "this international volunteer-run organization provides testing and verification of judges", " \u00a9 springer international publishing switzerland 2017 m", "mosher and k", "trantham, brewing science: a multidisciplinary approach, doi 10.1007/978-3-319-46394-0_2  35   36  2 beer styles  training for certification as a judge can also be useful, as judges need to not only know about the possible flavors that can exist in beer, but also they must be able to taste them in beer", "this means training your palate to identify the banana and clove components in a beer, to recognize and evaluate the carbonation that may or may not be present, and to have experience in recognizing how these components come together in a particular beer", " what areas do beer judges evaluate? this depends upon the competition", "but most competitions judge a beer based on its appearance, aroma, taste, and feel in the mouth", "the beer is carefully evaluated in each of these categories by the judges and a score generated", "then, beers can be compared based on the scores", "with multiple judges, the beer with the greatest score is selected as the winner", " 2.1.1 beer styles  if all of the beer in the world was made from an identical recipe, judging would be solely based on the process of the brewer, i.e., did the brewer follow the recipe correctly", "but this is not the case", "beer in the world is not the same from region to region and even from brewery to brewery", "we noted this in chap", "1", " beer was historically made from local ingredients", "in today\u2019s world, this still holds true, in a way", "if a brewer cannot get the ingredient, they do not make beer with it", "and to carry this a step farther, barley, hops, water, and yeast have many different varieties or cultivars", "with the added additions of adjuncts, variability in recipes, and even variability in the brewing process, beer is different everywhere you go", " however, there are beer recipes and processes that are relatively similar to each other", "many different attempts have been made to group these similar beers together into a common classification, known as a style", "it should be noted and stressed that beers are classified into styles based on their similarities", "beers begat styles, rather than styles giving rise to beers", " for example, the beer style known as the american lager became solidified after the us prohibition years", "this style began when brewers in the usa noted that to increase production with limited barley supplies, the heavy use of adjunct cereals (such as corn and rice) was needed", "recipes were formulated and explored", "the consumers knew what they liked, and over time, they preferred the taste of the beer that they could get", "the result was the style of the american lager", " 2.1.2 conforming to a style  conforming to a style means that the beer being examined has characteristics that match those expected for the style", "this does not mean that the beer is the best example of the style, nor does it mean that it is a beer that everyone would enjoy drinking", "all this means is that the beer has flavor and other characteristics that would be expected", "  2.1 judging beer  37  as we just noted above, everyone does not enjoy every style", "to be successful, a brewer in today\u2019s market should make beers that customers will drink", "this means that a brewer might make a series of styles and test their sales", "those that sell quickly might find a place in the brewery lineup", "those styles that do not sell or sell sluggishly might either be retired from the brewery, or be relegated to seasonal production", " the brewer need not construct recipes that fit within a particular style", "using the \u201ccustomer is always right\u201d theory, or during exploration of ingredients, the brewer might put together a beer that falls in between styles, combines the characteristics of two or more styles, or just does not conform to any styles", "for example, the interest of the beer consumer for the hoppier flavors found in the india pale ale style moved the brewery industry in some parts of the usa toward these ales", "the success of the ipa style led to breweries trying to push the boundaries of what customers would buy", "and the rate at which the new hoppier ipas were gobbled up led to even more pushes on the boundary", "today, the original ipa style is only a distant memory of what it once was", " today, many ipa-style beers sold on the west cost of the usa are very \u201chop-forward.\u201d in these brews, hops are used for bittering, for flavor, for more flavor, and for aroma", "then, more hops are added after the aroma hops just to make sure enough hop aroma is present", "some brewers even add another batch of hops just to really be sure", "and customers line up outside the brewery when the new batch is finally released", "names of the beers hint at the sheer masses of hops used in their creation: hoptimus prime, hopasaurus rex, modus hoperandi, hop stoopid, hoptopus, hop slam, hops of wrath, \u2026and the list goes on", "the new ultra-hoppy ipa caught on and is now ingrained in the typical brewer\u2019s portfolio", "the perva- siveness of the new version of the ipa has led to beer-style classifiers declaring a new style, the american ipa", " jokingly, but in most cases accurately, the authors of this textbook have often declared that the us version of any style is \u201cmore\u201d than what the style guidelines for the non-us version dictate", "many of the american versions of the styles are more alcoholic than their european cousins", "many are more malty, more hoppy, or more sugary", "the deviations are so \u201cout of style\u201d from the versions that they are attempting to emulate, that classifiers have granted new styles for these versions of the beers", "in short, conforming to a style does not have to happen", "a brewer can spend the time to do so, but there are no rules that require the brewer to follow the existing guidelines", "a brewer can formulate any recipe that they wish to create", " checkpoint 2.1 why do we say that a beer does not have to conform to a style? what is a beer style?   38  2 beer styles  2.2 parameters that classify a beer style  there are many characteristics of a beer that can be evaluated or measured", "in this section, we will explore those characteristics and outline the basic parameters that dictate the flavor characteristics for beer styles", "to ensure that the current batch of beer is the same as those previously made, the brewer can use these parameters", "alternatively, the consumer can use these values to judge the flavor or other properties of the beer prior to tasting", "for example, a consumer may choose a beer with a certain alcohol content, or one with a heavier bitterness to go with the food they are eating", " 2.2.1 physical parameters  ibu-the bitterness of the beer is often reported using a numerical scale known as the international bitterness units (ibu)", "in the usa, this is the scale of preference", "in europe, the scale used is known as the european bitterness units (ebu)", "in theory, both ibu and ebu should give the same values", "however, in practice, the ebu value is slightly lower due to the differences in how the measurements are made", " the bitterness measurement is actually a quantitative measure of the amount of iso-alpha acids that are present in the beer or wort", "it is not a measurement of the perceived bitterness when someone takes a drink of the beer; very malty or alco- holic beers have a perceived bitterness that is lower than the measured ibu value would suggest", " brewing scientists measure the bitterness in beer using a spectrophotometer", "the measurement is performed by extracting the acids into a solvent and then deter- mining the amount of light that is absorbed at 275 nm (in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum)", "the test in the laboratory is fairly straightforward, but does require some time as the beer and solvent must be shaken vigorously for 30 min", "abv alcohol content is often one of the first physical parameters that is evaluated by the consumer during sampling of the beer and the brewer during the construction of the recipe", "the brewer measures this parameter by many different methods", "first, the alcohol content can be estimated by measuring the amount of sugar that has been converted to alcohol", "and, if the brewer has access to a laboratory, the alcohol content can be determined by experiment", " in fact, the american society of brewing chemists (asbc) lists seven different methods for the experimental determination of alcohol content in beer", "the variety of methods includes distilling a small sample of beer to move the alcohol and some water away from the rest of the beer sample, then measuring the density of the distillate (fig", "2.1; table 2.1)", "other methods include the use of chemical instru- ments such as a refractometer, a gas chromatograph, or an instrument known as an alcoholyzer", "for concentrations below 0.5 %, the asbc recommends use of an enzyme (alcohol dehydrogenase) that is purchased separately", "the enzyme converts   2.2 parameters that classify a beer

terms of the amount of alcohol by volume (abv)", "concentrations in beer can run from 0.1 to 12 % and beyond", "most beers in the usa have an abv in the range of 4-7 %", "in europe, the average abv is a little lower", " abv does have an effect on the overall flavor of a beer", "if the amount of alcohol is high, the drinker will notice warmth in the mouth and stomach", "in some cases, if the abv is very high, the beer will have a pronounced warming effect that might detract from the other flavors of the beer", " og the original gravity (og) of the wort before it is fermented is often measured", "this parameter is an indicator of the amount of sugars in the liquid", "a higher wort original gravity dictates that there are a lot of sugars (both fermentable and unfermentable)", "a lower original gravity says there are fewer sugars", " the sugar concentration of the original wort does not dictate the amount of alcohol that will be produced", "while it can give the brewer an idea about the alcohol concentration, the amount of unfermentable sugars is not known", "the unfer- mentable sugars, as their name implies, will not be converted into alcohol by the yeast during fermentation", "instead, these sugars contribute to the sweetness and thickness of the beer after fermentation has taken place", " og can easily be measured using a glass device known as a hydrometer (see fig", "2.2)", "this instrument is placed into a sample of wort and allowed to float", "the higher it floats in the sample, the higher the original gravity", "the lower it sinks into the sample, the lower the original gravity", "the gravity of the liquid can also be measured easily by simply obtaining the weight of an accurate volume of the liquid", "for example, the brewer could determine the gravity by obtaining the mass of a quart of liquid", " gravity is just another name for the density of the sample", "density, or the mass of the sample per unit volume, can be represented by the brewer in the units of grams/milliliter (g/ml) or kilograms/cubic meter (kg/m3)", "and if the gravity (or density) was determined by measuring the mass of a quart of liquid, the brewer would divide the mass of the liquid by the volume of a quart", "typically, though, this is done using si units such as grams and milliliters", "for example, a standard pale ale might have an original gravity of 1.048 g/ml or 1048 kg/m3", "sometimes, a brewer may refer to a wort\u2019s density by just reporting the last two numbers of the density", "this type of reporting has been called the gravity units (gu)", "therefore, an og of 1.048 may be referred to as 48 gravity units (or 48 gu)", " the gravity can also be determined using other scales that reflect the amount of sugar directly", "in the brewing industry, the scale created in 1900 and named after the german fritz plato is used", "the scale is known as the plato scale and represents numbers in degrees plato (\u00b0p)", "this scale was based on the one developed in 1843   2.2 parameters that classify a beer style  41  fig", "2.2 the hydrometer", "this simple device is inexpensive and extremely versatile in the brewing laboratory", "it is placed into a sample of liquid and the density of the liquid read from the scale at the top  by karl balling (i.e., the balling scale), but improves upon that scale by using percent sucrose (by weight)", "dissolving a known mass of table sugar in a known mass of water provides the scale", "for example, 10.0 gm of sugar in 90.0 gm of water gives rise to a 10 % solution (10.0 g sugar/90.0 g water + 10.0 g sugar) that is reported as 10 \u00b0p", " degrees plato and density are not identical in values nor do they have a linear relationship between themselves", "the relationship is very close to linear, but is not, especially as the amount of sugar increases in the water", "however, a quick way to convert the gravity to an approximate \u00b0p value is to divide the decimal portion of the density by 4", "alternatively, the formula below will provide the conversion", "in other words, a gravity measurement of 1.048 g/ml would be approximately equal to a solution of 12 \u00b0p", "some hydrometers have both the density and the plato scales written on them", " \u00f0  gravity () 1  \u00fe () 250 () ()p  \u00f02:1\u00fe  fg final gravity (fg) is the density of the beer after fermentation has been

the beer and that were not fermented", "in other words, this is a measure of the amount of unfermented sugars", " in some cases, it is also a measure of the amount of fermentable sugars that were not fermented by the yeast", "this would occur if the yeasts quit working on the production of alcohol due to some reason (such as going dormant when the con- centration of alcohol got too high for the yeast to remain living in solution.)  fg is also measured easily using a hydrometer", "alternatively, the final gravity can be determined by weighing a known volume of the beer", "to measure the density, though, factoring in the density of the liquid alcohol must be taken into the density of alcohol-water mixtures is well known (see account", "luckily, table 2.1)", "and, the density of the alcohol water mixture does not deviate much from that of water alone in the abv range of most styles of beer", "however, as the concentration of alcohol climbs above 10 % abv, the amount of error in the fg reading increases", " srm the standard reference method (srm), used in the usa, refers to the measurement of the color of the beer sample", "the value of the color can also be reported as the ebc (european brewery convention) value", "srm and ebc differ by about a factor of 2", "measuring the amount of light absorbed by the beer sample at 430 nm and multiplying the value by 12.7 determines the value of srm", "the ebc method multiplies the value by 25", "the asbc methods of analysis require that the sample of beer is degassed (so that bubbles do not interfere) and that the sample is entirely free of turbidity (or cloudiness)", "in some cases, this means filtering the solids or centrifuging the sample", "for example, measuring the color of a hefeweizen (an often cloudy german wheat-style beer) dictates that the sample be filtered", "alternatively, the srm values can be determined by comparison of the beer color with a chart or colored disks that represent the colors along the scale from 1 to 40", " colors for beers can range from a very light straw or yellow color (srm 1-2) to a very dark or almost black beer (srm > 40) as shown in fig", "2.3", "a spectrum representing all of the wavelengths of light that typical beer samples absorb illus- trates that there is a continuous set of colors that beer can absorb", "coupled with the fact that multiple samples with fairly similar srm values can have very different appearances, beer researchers have been working on identifying a different way to quantify the color of a beer", "for example, it is entirely possible that an irish red ale could have the exact same srm as a belgium dubbel even though they have a very different appearance", " one such way to report the color of the beer involves the use of tristimulus color theory", "this theory suggests that all colors can be accurately reported using the combination of three primary colors in differing amounts", "when working on a   2.2 parameters that classify a beer style  43  fig", "2.3 srm colors for beer and wort analysis  computer, we sometimes create colors by inputting values for the amount of red, the amount of green, and the amount of blue to mix to make the color", "this is known as the rgb value for the color, one example of a tristimulus method for reporting the color", " for beer, however, the tristimulus color is reported in l*a*b* values, where l* is a number representing the \u201clightness\u201d of the color (0 = black; 100 = white), a* is a number representing the position of the color between green and red (<0 = green; >0 = red), and b* is a number for the position of the color between blue and yellow (<0 = blue; >0 = yellow)", "the three numbers are required in order to represent the actual color of the sample", " the asbc has developed a method for determining the tristimulus color of a beer sample", "the method requires the measurement of the absorbance of light at many different wavelengths at a given angle from the source of the light", "this is important, because the color of a beer sample is highly dependent upon the angle at which the sample is viewed in relationship to the source of light", "in other words, if you view the beer sample at 90\u00b0 from the light source, you would get a different set of l*a*b* values than if you view the sample from a 10\u00b0 angle", "the values for the measurement are also very dependent upon the level of carbonation and the degree of turbidity in the sample", " turbidity, or cloudiness, in a beer sample has a significant amount of impact on many of the measurements made by the beer scientist", "while some beer samples are naturally going to be turbid, such as a hefeweizen, the effect causes a lightening of the sample", "someone viewing the sample gets the impression that the beer is lighter in color than it actually is", "measuring the color using the tristimulus color method, then, requires that the beer is filtered", "  44  2 beer styles  checkpoint 2.2 it is said that the amount of alcohol, as abv, in a beer can be calculated using the equation (og \u2212 fg) * 131", "what is the abv if the og is 1.048 and the fg is 1.008? if the abv is 6.5 % and the og was 18 \u00b0p, what is the fg?  2.3 common beer styles  there many different style definitions for beer, as we noted above", "these include the beer judge certification program\u2019s 2015 guidelines that are periodically updated and/or retooled to account for new style classifications", "they also include the brewer\u2019s association\u2019s guidelines that are annually updated to reflect changes in the classification details", "while both are available online, they represent some significant details about beer styles that are beyond the scope of this textbook", "however, with that said, we will explore some of the basic classification details that allow us to make some statements about beer styles", "to aid this process, we will break the styles down into two main categories and each category into regional styles", "a hybrid style breakdown will capture the majority of the rest of the styles", " 2.3.1 lagers  the lager style of beer was likely first started in the 1500 or 1600s in germany", "by 1860, the style had grown significantly in popularity", "it is this \u201cnew\u201d beer pro- duction process that caught on in the usa as german immigrants moved to the usa", " lagers are characterized by the use of bottom-fermenting yeast (saccharomyces pastoranus)", "this yeast strain requires the use of low temperatures during the fermentation step in brewing and followed by maturation or conditioning of the beer under very cool conditions", "during the initial stages of the development of this major style classification, beer was fermented in caves or cellars where the tem- perature did not get very high", "in fact, lagering may be part of the reason for statements in the reinsheitgebot about different prices for beer were acceptable at different times of the year", "during winter months, beer was less expensive because it was fermented and aged during the previous summer when the temperatures were warm", "beer fermented and aged at these higher temperatures often had many more flavors added from the yeast", "the warmer temperatures ended up producing a beer that was not as crisp or clean", "during the summer, the beer that was sold was fermented and aged over the previous winter (when the temperatures were colder)", "the colder temperatures produced fewer off-flavors and gave rise to a crisper,   2.3 common beer styles  45  cleaner beer", "but, this took longer to ferment and age, hence the slightly higher price", " from michaelmas (september 29) to georgi (april 23), the price for one mass or one kopf, is not to exceed one pfennig munich value, and from georgi to michaelmas, the mass shall not be sold for more than two pfennig of the same value, the kopf not more than three heller", " the advent of refrigeration in the early 1800s meant that lagers were possible in locations that did not have access to year-round cool places", "because of the low temperatures during fermentation and conditioning, the yeast slowly converted sugars in the wort into beer", "the process produced very few off-flavors", "therefore, lagers, in general, have a crisp clean flavor", "they represent almost every color possible with other styles, but typically the head on the beer is white or off-white", "many lagers are very carbonated and bubbly, and many are relatively still", " 2.3.1.1 european lagers european lagers are quite varied", "while some accounts suggest that the lager style began as early as the mid-fifteenth century in munich and its surroundings, the repeated brewing season over the winter months likely selected the lager strain of yeast", "in the colder temperatures, the yeast that fell to the bottom of the fermenter had a better chance of surviving the cold", "and thus, the style was born", " many of the european lagers are represented in the traditional beers of germany, france, and the czech republic", "these lagers differ in the ingredients that tradi- tionally are grown in the specific areas, but all have a fairly similar set of characteristics", " pilsner the beer produced and consumed near the town of plzen, czech republic, best represents the pilsner style of lager", "this style, first brewed in the early 1840s, is characterized by its golden color and slightly malty flavor", "noble hops tend to complement the flavor", "boiling portions of the mash as the beer is made (in a process known as decoction mashing) help to darken and flavor the beer", "it is relatively lower in alcohol (*4 % abv) and is very drinkable and refreshing", " amber and dark lagers a slightly darker style of lagers characterizes these styles", "anton dreher (vienna lager) and gabriel sedlmayr (oktoberfest) created two of the common members of this style after the lager yeast was identified and isolated", "the style is characterized by a malt-forward profile with a slightly higher alcohol content than the pilsner style (*5 % abv)", "the roasty malty flavor of the beer is coupled with crisp finish", "many of the examples of these styles are found served at festivals in october in germany", " bock this style of beer, which includes the dopplebock and eisbock, was histor- ically made by brewers in the german town of einbeck", "when consumers in munich first tasted this style of beer, it was an instant hit", "they referred to the style as the beer made in \u201ceinbeck.\u201d over time, the style became known as \u201cein bock.\u201d   46  2 beer styles  ein bock in german literally means \u201cone goat.\u201d the name stuck and is the reason beers of this style often have a goat on the label", " the main style of this category tends to be fairly malty with a relatively high alcohol content (*6.5 % abv)", "the dopplebock (or double-bock) has typically the same amount of hops as the bock, but a little more alcohol (ranging from 7 to 10 % abv)", "partially freezing a bock and then removing the ice results in the eisbock version (eisbock literally translates to \u201cice bock\u201d)", "the ice that is removed contains mostly water, but also contains a small amount of the off-flavors that are made during fermentation of the bock", "thus, the style becomes a little more malty with a greater alcohol content (ranging from 8 % abv on up)", "repeated partial freezing and removal of the ice can continue to \u201cpurify\u201d the flavor and increase the alcohol content", "some commercial examples of the eisbock have greater than 30 % abv", " 2.3.1.2 english lagers lagers in england are not the style that was originally preferred by consumers", "however, in modern times, the lager style has become one of the best selling products", "it is a bottom-fermented beer that is very crisp and clean in its flavors", "adjuncts, such as rice, are used to lighten the flavor of the beer, but most are made solely with lighter kilned malts", "the lighter color and flavor of these beers com- pliments the lighter alcohol content (ranging from 3.5 to 4.5 % abv)", "the low-alcohol content, light color, and crisp finish are likely the reason for their appeal", " 2.3.1.3 american lagers the american lager style is probably the best selling beer style worldwide (based on the amount of consumption of this style in north america alone)", "it is typically made with large amount of adjunct cereals (such as rice and corn)", "both of these adjuncts ferment very cleanly and lend themselves well to the crisp, clean flavor of the beer", "and in some cases, the beers mimic the flavors of the pilsners made in the czech republic", "this particular style ranges on the lighter end of the abv spec- trum (from about 3.5-7.0 abv) and on the lighter end of the srm scale (from about srm 2-6)", "the drinkability of the style also arises from the high levels of carbonation", "many, the authors included, have noted that there is nothing better to drink on a hot summer day after mowing the yard", " while some classifications make a distinction between the american lager and the lower calorie versions of this style, we consider that they are in the same major classification", "similarly, rather than making a distinction between those made exclusively in the usa versus those made in canada, mexico, or other countries, the major style classification is somewhat identical across the entire set of examples from these countries", "  2.3 common beer styles  47  checkpoint 2.3 what is the relationship between saccharomyces pastoranus and saccha- romyces bayous?

ales  the traditional method for the preparation of beer used yeast that fermented on the top of the wort", "the top-fermenting yeast is saccharomyces cerevisiae", "this species of yeast prefers a slightly warmer temperature during fermentation, and with this warmer temperature, the yeast produces additional chemical compounds that give flavors to the beer", "the flavors of ales tend not to be as crisp and clean as the lager, but contain some lingering flavors and mouthfeel that truly influence the experience of drinking", "because of this, a wider variety of ales exist", " homebrewers often start their exploration of the craft by creating ales", "this is an easier style of beer to make and is a great one in which to practice the craft of brewing", "the style does not require the colder temperatures of fermentation and conditioning that the lager styles require", "and, the ability to create malty, hoppy, sour, and other flavors easily is very accessible", " the microbrewer and startup brewery also tend to focus on the preparation of this style for the same reasons", "ales are easier to produce, and the variability of the ingredients and yeast varieties alone gives rise to a wide variety of flavors", "fur- thermore, the need for expensive refrigeration, decoction, and/or longer time from production to sale makes the ale the obvious choice", " as we noted, there are a very wide variety of ales", "many are simple modifica- tions of the original", "basic groupings of these into three main style classifications are discussed here", " 2.3.2.1 european ales beers from belgium, france, and to some extent germany predominate this clas- sification", "the german version of this class of styles tends to be made with wheat or rye", "in many cases, the wheat must occupy at least 50 % of the total amount of grains used to make the beer", "because of this, many of the styles are cloudy due to the high levels of wheat proteins", "they tend not to be very bitter, but

showcase rich, deep, and complex flavors", "they  can be divided into two main categories based on this", "  48  2 beer styles  sour ales these range from slightly tart or barely perceivable sourness to the very sour", "the base of the beers comes from the use of pale malt (and sometimes from the use of large amounts of wheat)", "as a class of beer, the malty flavors are complemented with complex fruity and/or spicy notes", "the level of alcohol ranges dramatically based upon the specific style or region in which the beer is made", "the most predominant flavor is that of the sourness due to the use of wild yeast, lactobacillus (which produces lactic acid-a sour flavored compound), or bret- tanomyces (a yeast strain that produces many off-flavors along with a mild sourness)", " sour ales in this category include styles known as saison, oud bruin, witbier, berliner weisse, lambic, and geuze (not to be confused with gose-a beer made from salty water with added coriander spices)", "many of the beer styles in this category originate from what is referred to as a \u201cfarmhouse\u201d style", "this refers to the early production of beers by residents making their own beers at their home", "with limited equipment, the beers often were inoculated using spontaneous fermentation", "the results of allowing spontaneous fermentation are the inclusion of some wild strains of yeast and bacteria", "these strains become stable in the overall beer-making process as they inhabit the casks that are used", "mild and wild flavors (sourness, complex fruity, spicy) often result from this method", " belgian ales ales made in belgium are typically malt-forward with an alcohol content that is greater than the sour ales (ranging from 6 to 12 % abv)", "these beers also have a very complex flavor and darker colors", "aromas and flavors of prunes, raisins, and other dried fruits can be found in the styles", "while hops are these strong fruity flavors and malty background gives the drinker the used, impression of wine", "the higher levels of alcohol in the beers give rise to their names: dubbel, tripel, quadrupel, etc", " particularly noteworthy examples of this style are those made by trappist monks", "the trappist order is originated in france and throughout the middle ages, and this order produced beer for the local communities", "over the ages, the beers and style that were produced became quite desirable by those fortunate enough to sample them", "today, eleven trappist breweries exist and are the only ones licensed to brew beer and call it a trappist ale (the oldest brewery with this designation is the basserie du rochefort that began in 1595)", "for a brewery to be allowed to use the trappist designation, its beers must be made inside a trappist monastery, not as the primary work of the monastery, and the proceeds from the sale of the beers must only go to cover the living expenses of those in the monastery", "any remaining profits are donated to charities", " related examples of the trappist ales are known as abbey ales", "when brew- eries are unable to be classified as trappist, they can still produce beers that are similar in style, although they are not held to the same rigorous style guidelines", "however, brewers are not just allowed to use the trappist name to describe the flavors that they have created", "so, they use the name \u201cabbey\u201d to refer to their beers", "  2.3 common beer styles  49  2.3.2.2 english, scottish, and irish ales the classification of the ales from england, scotland, and ireland includes a wide variety of relatively similar products", "the similarities are not very obvious, but exist in the type of malt and hops that are used in the creation of these beers", "while grouping the myriad of different styles into this one category eliminates many of the special styles that deserve individual mention, the general trends in the differences of the styles are the intent", " english ales this class of styles is quite varied", "with the exception of the barley wine, imperial stout, and robust porter styles, the entire class of ales typically has an alcohol content at the lower end of the spectrum (ranging from 3 to 6 % abv, with many of the examples falling in the 4-5 % abv range)", "malt tends to predominate the main flavors with a noble hop aroma and flavor", "most are very well balanced between malty and hoppy", " as the demand for these ales outside of the country became high, the brewers began adding additional hops or increasing the alcohol levels in order to improve the shelf life of the beers", "this was necessary as many of the ales had to be shipped overseas on long voyages", "when the lighter colored pale ales were stored in kegs with additional hops added and then shipped to colonies in india, the beer style known as the india pale ale was born", "when the darker more malty beers were brewed to contain higher levels of alcohol and shipped to russia, the imperial stout and robust porter styles were produced", "but for the exported beers, the majority of the styles in england were very drinkable throughout the day with lower alcohol contents", " one of the more interesting styles in this category is the porter", "this beer was initially produced in the 1700s as a drink for the workers in the shipyards (i.e., the porters who loaded and unloaded ships)", "it was first made around 1721, though historical records are somewhat confusing as to which brewery is likely the pro- ducer", "brewers noted that they could sell beer that was flavorful, but had a lower abv, to these customers at lunch, dinner, or after a shift, if it were inexpensive to purchase and not inebriating", "and the beers sold quite well as a thirst quencher", "at the time, most of the inexpensive malt was kilned over wood fires and had a smoky aroma and flavor and a brown color", "the beers, thus, also had these flavors and colors", "the smoky flavors likely were reduced by relatively longer maturation times in wooden casks or kegs", "as the industrial revolution brought about cheaper ways to make malt (without the smoky flavor or darker color), the brewers modified the recipes by adding chocolate malts and roasted barley to give back the darker colors to the finished product", "the porter style almost died out entirely when customer preference for lighter ales became the trend, but has since found a resurgence in the craft beer drinker", "  50  2 beer styles  the porter style is a deep dark-colored beer that is very malt-forward", "it typically has a lower alcohol content (ranging from 4 to 6 % abv) with complex caramel, coffee, and/or chocolate notes", "it has a light-colored, almost white, head that appears contrary to the dark color of the beer", "and, it is very drinkable", " the porter is not to be confused with the stout, but is currently a very close cousin to the stout", "the stout began as simply a stronger version of beer; a customer might ask for a \u201cstout porter,\u201d meaning a stronger version of the porter", "in fact, the first mention of a stout in 1677 likely predates the production of a beer known as a porter", "the stout, as a current style, has a dark, almost black, appearance and a pronounced bitterness that complements the roasty, toasty, somewhat \u201cdarker\u201d flavors of caramel", "the head can be white, but also can be tan to brown in color", "alcohol concentrations range from 4 to 6 % typically, but can be much higher in the imperial or extra categories of stout", "scottish ales the more malty flavors of the scottish ales are obvious in this class", "the limited use of hops is apparent with some earthy or estery flavors", "the result is a malt-forward beer that has very little hoppiness or bitterness", "while this is the case, the result is not an overly cloying or sweet flavor", "the alcohol content tends to range from about 2-5 % abv, and is often denoted in the number of shillings associated with the name of the beer", "for example, a 90-shilling scottish ale would have a higher abv than a 60-shilling version", "the color of the ale also can be related to the number of shillings and ranges from a golden to copper color", " irish ale the most commonly thought of irish ale is likely the stout", "this style of beer is characterized by a very dark, almost black, color and a hop bitterness that is accentuated by the use of roasted and darker malts and barleys", "the darker roasty flavors and astringency from the use of these grains is characteristic of the style", "the creamy tan-colored head on the beer is a necessity", "increased alcohol contents are found in the export versions of the irish stout", "guinness makes one of the more recognized versions of the irish stout", "initially, the beer we know as guinness extra stout was known as extra superior porter, reflecting the appropriation of the word \u201cstout\u201d as a stronger version of the porter style", " also in this class is the irish red", "this beer style is malty but has a strong bitterness from a hop addition early in the production of the beer", "often the grains used are such that the color of the beer is deep amber to red or copper", "very little, if any, hops are noted in the aroma or flavor of the beer", "and the alcohol content tends to be in the 4-6 % abv range", "the result is a very drinkable beer with a dry finish that invites another sip", " 2.3.2.3 american ales as expected with this classification, the sky is the limit for any of the ales produced", "many are mimics of the styles found elsewhere on the globe", "however, in mim- icking the style, many of the brewers exaggerate or downplay a characteristic or two (or more) for the original style", "this does not mean that these are poor versions of   2.3 common beer styles  51  the original style, but instead that they are examples of an american version of the style", " for example, many different breweries in the usa have produced mimics of the india pale ale style from england", "the more successful ipas, in terms of consumer preference, are extremely hop-forward", "as we noted in sect", "2.1.2, this particular style has been taken to the far extreme", " another example lies in the american version of the porter style", "this style is often very flavor-forward with emphasis on the use of chocolate- or coffee-flavored malts", "in some cases, the american porter is flavored with the addition of cold coffee extract or chocolate nibs (cocoa beans) to emphasize those flavors in the finished beer", " checkpoint 2.4 how is it possible that the same flavor of a farmhouse style ale from belgium could be obtained from spontaneous

beer styles have been lost to time, but were described or written about in historical documents", "these styles either fell out of favor with the consumers, their ingredients became difficult to obtain, or laws and rules eliminated the options available to make these beers", "the rapid growth in interest for craft beers has resulted in these styles being reintroduced", " for example, george

become very well-known commercial products", "for example, the kottbusser style was originally descriptive of the ale made from wheat, oats, malt, honey, and molasses", "a couple of commercial breweries in the usa have revived the style", " some us brewers take specific steps to research and then produce a style of beer that has not been tried in the modern ages or is fairly rare on the us market", "this includes the kottbusser ale, the kentucky common ale (preprohibition ale common in louisville), the gose ale (made with salt water, coriander, and sour-producing bacteria), and grodziskie (a polish smoked-wheat ale)", "additional styles and recipes continue to be located in the literature nearly every day", "its likely the better tasting ones will find their way to the commercial market", " one particular example of a little known style in north america is quite com- mon in south america, chicha", "chicha is a drink that pre-dates the european migration to the new world", "this beer style is entirely corn based (with flavorings added both pre- and post-fermentation)", "since the corn is not malted prior to fer- mentation, masticating (chewing) the corn provided the enzymes needed to mash the corn", "spontaneous fermentation from wild yeast produced the finished cloudy beer", "yes, at least one commercial brewery produces chicha in the usa", "and yes, the brewers take turns chewing on the corn and then spitting it into the mash tun", "this definitely sounds like a beer everyone should try", " a search of old manuscripts, letters, and documents from the library (or digital library) may reveal a new beer recipe that has fallen into obscurity or even extinction", "a little research and you may become the brewer that resurrects the style", " checkpoint

the bottle or can, this is not how the brewer likely intended their hard work to be consumed", "to honor the brewer\u2019s work, the glass should be used to truly enjoy the beer", " in fact, specific types of glasses go with specific styles of beers", "it is the beer drinker\u2019s responsibility to make sure that the beer they are examining is consumed from the glass that works best", "that is the glass the brewer envisioned as they constructed the recipe, and it is the glass that best accentuates the style of the beer", "and with the myriad of styles that exist, there are an accompanying wide variety of glasses to choose from", " the basic styles of glasses are shown in fig", "2.4", "they include glasses that are tall and short, fat and skinny, and round and straight", "the pilsner

light-colored beers, such as those of the oktoberfest style, but even other low-alcohol beers can also be used", "related to the mug or tankard is the beer stein", "the stein is often a ceramic vessel with a pewter lid (originally put there to keep out flies), but wooden, leather, and glass versions do exist", " the weizen glass is a tall glass with a protrusion in the wall that gives the top of

measurement and require that the beer be served at the appropriate temperature, and in the appropriate glass, in order to get the most from the sampling", "some judging takes place by pouring the beer samples into small taster glasses", "while the judges understand how to adjust their analysis to account for the small glass, this is not even close to the appropriate method for maximum enjoyment of the brewer\u2019s project", " the key features of the sensory evaluation that are typically explored are as  follows:  \u2022 appearance, \u2022 aroma, \u2022 taste, and \u2022 mouthfeel", " the appearance of the beer is determined by evaluating the beer in two steps", "first, as the beer is poured, special attention is paid to the quality of the \u201cpour.\u201d is the beer thick and syrupy, or is it thin and watery as it is poured", "second, the beer is examined in the glass like a fine gemstone", "it is held up to the light to judge its color, which also gives the judge the opportunity to examine the bubbles and the head on the beer itself", " the amount or thickness of the head often results in the perceived quality of the beer", "is the head thick and rich with small beer-covered bubbles, or it is small and thin? are the bubbles uniform in size and mostly small? is the head similar throughout, or are there regions where the bubbles seem to clump into large \u201cicebergs\u201d?  then, the next step in analyzing and enjoying the beer is to hold the glass close to the nose and allow the aroma to be sampled", "the aroma can be based on the hops that are added near the end of the boil, but can also come from other sources", "does the malt shine through into the aroma? can you smell the off-flavors of diacetyl (butter), apple (acetaldehyde), vinegar (acetic acid), or creamed corn (dimethyl sulfide)", "while some of the off-flavor aromas are needed and required as part of the style, many are not and should not be found in beer", " multiple ways to pull a sample of the aroma of the beer into the nose exist", "one such way is to rapidly pull small amounts of the beer into the nose with miniature exhales", "in this method, approximately 4-5 small puffs of the aroma are brought into the nose within as many seconds", "the beer should then be removed from under the nose immediately after the puffs are sampled", "in another method, the beer is placed near the nose and the sampler then pulls a long deep draw into the lungs", "again, the beer is removed away from the nose as quickly as possible after the   2.5 how to sample and taste beer  57  sample", "if the glass is small enough, such as the sampling glasses found at a judging competition, the hands can be cupped around the mouth of the glass and then around the nose", "in this way, only the aromas from the beer are pulled into the nose", "of course, with any of these methods, it is imperative that the sampler not be wearing heavy cologne or perfume", "the use of hand creams should be avoided (even the unscented ones can have an impact on the aroma of the beer)", "other distractions, such as loud music, talking, and overly bright lights, can have a negative impact on the sampler\u2019s ability to judge the aromas of the beer", " the beer taster then puts a small sample in their mouth (about 10-15 ml or 0.5 oz) and swishes it around", "there are many ways to do this", "one of the easier ways is to pretend that you are eating a bit of food and chewing the beer", "in other words, the consumer moves their jaw up and down while sampling the beer", "the effect is to add oxygen into the beer and allowing the vapors from the beer to mix as they go to the back of the throat", "those vapors are the aroma of the beer and must hit the palate fully oxygenated in order to give the appropriate result", " sometimes, the beer is spit out of the mouth", "for a judging process or for those beer aficionados visiting a beer festival, this is not a bad thing", "with the shear volume of samples, it is not required that the beer be swallowed in order to determine the appearance, aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel", "as anton ego, a food critic in the movie ratatouille said:

experience that assists in determining the overall characteris- tics of a beer is known as the \u201cmouthfeel.\u201d to use a tautology, mouthfeel is how the beer feels when it is in your mouth",

of sensations: after effects, carbonation, and thickness", "some descriptors (words that describe the sensation) that are related to the mouthfeel of a beer include warming (from alcohol), astringent (tea-like dryness), flat (no bubbles), gassy (opposite of flat), creamy (coats the mouth like milk), and thin (like water)", " judges often record their notes in each of the four categories to assist in their grading of the beer sample", "in some cases, this is very helpful to the brewer (whether they win first place or not), because the notes can provide information about another person\u2019s

of the major and most important analyses to perform is the sensory analysis", "in fact, even if a microbrewer or nanobrewer lacks a laboratory to calculate the key aspects of a brew, they should still have access to a panel of tasters", "by giving samples to the tasters, the brewer can learn about off-flavors, consistency, and other aspects of the beers that they make", "these results should be

member of the grass family", "it is likely that the barley plant was first cultivated in mesopotamia around 10,000 bc, about the same time as wheat", "since that time, it has been cultivated, selected, and bred to produce the numerous different cultivars that are used currently", "each of these is grown for different purposes; barley destined for beer is often considered to be very high-quality grain", " barley is typically grown in cooler climates since it has a relatively short growing season compared to other cereal crops", "in north america, it is grown in the northern

basic types of barley used when classifying the grain", "depending on how the spikelets and seeds are arranged on the central spine of the seed head, the barley is known as 2-row, 4-row, or 6-row", "two-row barley has two rows of seeds on each spike, but has one fertile floret per node", "four-row barley has four rows of seeds", "similarly, 6-row has six rows of seed on each spike, but only three fertile florets per node", "wild barley is of 2-row variety", "the 4-row and 6-row varieties were historically selected after domestication and grown for different purposes", "as a malted grain, 2-row barley tends to have lower protein content", "four- and six-row barley varieties have higher protein contents", "while four-row barley is typically not used in brewing, the six-row variety has found widespread the slightly higher protein use", "with modern brewing and malting processes, content is not much of an issue as we will see in the next section (fig", "4.1)", " once harvested, the barley is stored in silos and dried until it has less than 14 % water content", "after the seed reaches that level of water content, the barley can be sold", "often, however, it is stored for 1-2 months (or longer in some cases)", "while the reasons are not entirely understood, this storage helps reduce the dormancy of the seeds", " prior to sale, however, the seeds are cleaned", "this

civilizations probably also noted this and conducted fairly elaborate techniques (such as allowing the grain to rot, or making barley dough and bread before making beer)", "we now know that the required sugars are packed away in the endosperm of the seed as starch", "these are energy stores originally intended for a newly sprouting plant", "to harvest that starch and convert it into sugars, the cleaned, sorted barley is sent to the maltster", " the maltster begins the process by soaking the seeds in water", "this tricks the barley into thinking it is time to sprout", "during this time, the \u201cgerm\u201d part of the seed begins to grow into the acrospire; i.e., germinate (see fig", "4.2)", "this process acti- vates and develops diastatic enzymes inside the seed", "it also starts the process of unlocking starches from the endosperm", "in short, the seed begins to grow by converting its stored starch into sugars", "unless halted, however, the seed will continue to grow and consume all of the starches that are needed for brewing", "simply drying out the seed and heating it slightly halts the sprouting process", "the rootlets that grew from the seed are then mechanically separated from the grain", "at this point, the malted grain is ready for the brewer and is frequently called pale malt (fig", "4.3)", " plain, pale malt accounts for up to 100 % of a brewer\u2019s grain bill depending on beer style", "the purpose of the pale malt in the recipe is to provide diastatic enzymes and at least some of the fermentable sugars", "diastatic power, a measure of the malt\u2019s ability to convert starches into sugars, is a measure of the ability of the malt to do this job", "but, pale malt, by itself, does not provide the brewer with enough variability to make all of the styles of beer", "so, to provide different flavor profiles required for those different beer styles, the brewer uses specialty malts", " specialty malts are made in many different ways", "some are made by heating the pale malt in a kiln until it browns (fig", "4.4)", "the browning or toasting of the malts occurs via the maillard reactions we uncovered in chap", "3", "these reactions

different degrees of heat will yield different flavor profiles for the malted grain", "the only downside is that the excessive heat required to toast the grain will denature the enzymes and reduce the diastatic power of the malt", " other specialty malts are made by soaking the pale malt in warm water", "this activates the malts to begin sugar production, but since the pale malt roots and shoots have been damaged, the seed cannot grow", "instead, the sugars collect in and on the seeds", "when these seeds are then dried and kilned, they result in a great source of caramel, toffee, and roasty malt flavors", "the kilning process, however, also reduces the diastatic power to essentially zero", "these sugary malts are known as crystal malt (due to the presence of crystals of sugar on the surface of the seeds) or caramel malts (because of the flavors they provide)", " a brewer has a wide variety of malted and toasted grains to design different beer taste profiles", "but, malting and

"once the malt is obtained, it undergoes mashing", "mashing can be considered an extension of malting, in that we are adding water again to the grain", "this time, however, the maltster has removed the rootlets and kilned the malt", "the result is that many of the enzymes needed for growth have been denatured, and the lack of the root makes the seed unviable as a plant", "so the addition of water at this point does not result in growing seeds", " the malted grain is crushed to expose the white-starchy endosperm (see fig", "4.5)", "the resulting grist, broken pieces of grain and husks, can be as fine as powder or only slightly crushed depending upon the brewers requirements", "the grist and warm water are mixed and added to the mash tun, giving us the mash", "there is some allowed variability to the water/grist ratio, but the mash typically has a consistency of fairly runny oatmeal", " in some cases, the brewer may take grains that have not been malted and harvest the starch from them for the mash", "this involves a separate step where crushed grains are added to a separate vessel known as a cereal cooker", "water is added to the grist, and then the entire mixture is heated to the gelatinization temperature for the particular grain used (see table 4.1)", "this step causes the starch in the endo- sperm of the grain to be released into the mixture", "the entire

convert the starches into sugars", "malt is required to provide those enzymes", " in the mashing step, enzymes developed during the germination (malting) pro- cess convert the available starches to sugars", "the ultimate goal of mashing is to break down large starch molecules into sugars which can be digested by yeast, i.e., saccharification", "the mashing process can involve several temperature rests depending on what process the brewer wishes to accomplish (create more sugars, reduce the amount of proteins, etc.)", "a rest is a period of time in which the mash is held at a specific temperature", "these different rests are discussed in chap", "6", " in the modern age of brewing, nearly all malted grain available on the com- mercial market is fully modified-meaning that the maltster has germinated the seeds until all of the endosperm has been acted upon by enzymes", "the maltster does offer some partially modified malts that require special mashing rest steps to fully utilize", "however, for most styles of beer, the brewer acquires fully modified malt and really only needs to execute the saccharification rest", "the mash temperature typically is held constant at a value between 140 and 155 \u00b0f where it rests for 60 min", "programmed temperature running with multiple rests can reduce the time to as little as 20 min, but this requires specialized equipment to accomplish", "during this rest, the starches in the endosperm of the malted barley are steadily converted into fermentable and un-fermentable sugars", "with appropriate starting water chemistry, a ph in the range of 5-6 is naturally established in the mash", "this ph is essential for the saccharification enzymes to work", " there are two saccharification enzymes that remain active in the malt after kilning at the malster\u2019s factory", "these enzymes become activated again during the mash", "it is possible for the brewer to fine-tune the final taste profile of the beer by adjusting the temperature within the 140-155 \u00b0f range", "as discussed in chap", "6, this can result in beer that is thin and alcoholic, thick and malty, or any combination of these profiles (fig", "4.6)", " at the end of the mash period, it is often desirable to halt the further conversion of long sugar chains to shorter, more fermentable chains", "in this case, the brewer will execute a mash-out by raising the temperature of the mash just high enough to halt enzymatic activity, and preserve the sugar profile", "this higher temperature also helps break down any proteins and glutens and helps reduce the

sugar water from the grain", "there are a variety of approaches to accomplish this task", "in some instances, the entire mash (grist and sugar water) is pumped into a different vessel known as a lauter tun", "the water is then slowly drained from the grain while being gently rinsed with warm water (sparging)", "the lauter tun is wider and less deep than the mash tun", "in addition, the lauter tun often contains a series of knives or rakes that can be rotated around the grain bed", "by raising and lowering the knives, the grain bed can be gently stirred as it is being drained and rinsed", "this helps ensure that all of the sugar is rinsed from the spent grains", " in some breweries, the grist has been ground into a relatively fine powder", "this type of mash provides an increase in sugar production with a concomitant decrease   4.1 overview of the process  103  in the time involved", "one problem exists, though, in that filtering this type of mash using a lauter tun does not work", "in this case, the mash is pumped into a mash filter", "inside the mash filter, bladders are used to squeeze the liquid away from the mash flour", "then, sparge water is added, and the mash flour squeezed again to remove all of the sugar water", "this process, while requiring expensive equipment, is very efficient at extracting the sweet wort from the grist", " in smaller brewing operations, the mash tun and lauter tun are a combined vessel", "in this case, the sparge water trickles through the deeper bed of grain and rinses it of the sugars", "in both cases, the sparge water is often held at a fairly high temperature and relatively low ph", "these characteristics help assure the brewer that all of the sugars are removed while reducing the possibility of extracting the tea-like tannin from the husks", "both vessels also have a false bottom with a large number of small holes that allow the sugar water to drain, but retain the spent grain", " the sugary, malty liquid that the brewer extracts from the mash is called sweet wort", "it is a relatively thin liquid that contains some proteins, individual amino acids, metal cations (such as calcium, magnesium, and others), and a mixture of fermentable and unfermentable sugars", "if the sweet wort was just drained away from the grains, a significant amount of sugar would remain in the nooks and crannies of the grist", "the problem is that the majority of the sweet wort is held in the matrix of the grist owing to a relatively large surface tension of the water; much in the same way that water adheres in a sponge (fig", "4.7)", " as we have seen, sparging is the process of rinsing the sweet wort away from the spent grain", "ideally, the sparge water will rinse away the concentrated sweet wort, leaving behind plain water in the spent grain", "however, there are two primary issues that arise with sparging", "with excessive amounts of sparge water, the final batch of sweet wort becomes much less concentrated", "unless the brewer invests the energy to concentrate the wort, the final beer will be weaker, both in taste and in final alcohol content", "and, as we discovered above and will cover in more detail in  fig", "4.7 general overview of the use of sparge water to rinse the mash", "sweet wort is separated from spent grain in the lauter/sparge step", "this typically takes 20-60 min, or

(husks of the grist) becomes a very big issue", " for all but the mash filter process, there are a variety of process methods that can be used in the sparging step", "each type of sparging profile has its pros and cons and can be traced back to traditional procedures employed by different cultures", "the three basic procedures are as follows:  continuous (or fly) sparge as water is drained from mash, a continuous supply of warm water is sprinkled above the grains at the same rate that sweet wort is drained", "the water level is kept above the level of the mash grains", "this has the potential to extract more of the sweet wort, resulting in better brew-house effi- ciencies over other sparging processes", "the largest issue with this method is that as the sweet wort is drained from the mash, the additional sparge water causes the runoff to become less and less concentrated", "this, in turn, causes the ph to rise back toward the ph of the sparge water", "if the ph rises above 6, the potential exists for tannin to be extracted from the husks", "the process requires an attentive brewer and must be stopped when the sugar concentration of the sweet wort drops below and/or the ph begins to rise above a predetermined point", " cleanup of the mash tun in a continuous sparge process is somewhat involved", "the excess sparge water must be drained away from the spent grains as the first step", "it is possible that this water, unusable as sweet wort, could be used to mash in the next batch, assuming the brewer is interested in making another batch that day and that the ph of the water was still below 6", "then, the spent grains must be scooped out of the vessel", "the water that has been absorbed by the grains makes this process very laborious", "finally, the spent grains must be removed from the brewery", "many brewers sell or donate these to area ranchers to be mixed with roughage for their animals", " no sparge quite simply, the no sparge method is just that", "the water from the grain bed is allowed to drain directly without addition of water", "there is no risk of dilution of the sweet wort or extraction of tannin in this method", "however, brew-house efficiency is greatly reduced, because a lot of usable sugars remain in the spent grains", "this method is particularly useful for creating very-high-gravity beers", "cleaning the vessel after the no sparge method is very similar to the batch sparge, however, there is no, or very little, waste water from the process", " batch sparge similar to the no-sparge method, the batch sparge method allows the sweet wort to be drained away from the grain bed until no more liquid is removed", "this batch of sweet wort is called the first runnings and is very rich in sugars", "the first runnings, as in the no-sparge method, can be used to make a high alcohol beer", "then, the mash-lauter tun is re-filled with sparge water, mixed to allow the water to rinse all around the grains, allowed to settle, and then re-drained", "the second runnings can be used to make a lower alcohol content beer, historically known as a small beer", "the first and second runnings can be combined into one batch or portioned out into two or more batches of different gravities", "this is an   4.1 overview of the process  105  improvement over no sparge approach in that efficiency improves with the second rinse", "again, care must be exercised to ensure that the ph in the second runnings has not changed to a point where tannin is extracted", "in some cases, a third batch of sparge water could be obtained by adding more water, stirring the mash, allowing it to settle, and then draining off the liquid", "third runnings have very little fer- mentable sugars, but can still be fermented to prepare a very weakly alcoholic beer, or mixed in proportions with the other runnings to create beers of different alcohol content", " checkpoint 4.3 visit your local microbrewery", "which type of sparging system do they use? describe its operation", "what is the purpose of sparging?  4.1.5 boiling  the brewer then pumps the sweet wort into the boil kettle", "it is then heated to boiling for a given period of time, typically 30-90 min", "the exact time is deter- mined by the outcome required by the brewer", "in addition, there are several different types of boil kettles that can be used for the process, but we will cover them in much more detail in chap", "10", " there are several reasons we boil the wort", "we briefly touch on the main reasons here", "historically, the wort was boiled to kill harmful microorganisms and to allow the flavors of any other added ingredients to mix", "this was important to early cultures as modern water purification procedures were non-existent", "early beer was relatively weak, but since it had undergone this boiling step, it was safer (and healthier) to drink than the primitive water sources of the day", "interestingly, these cultures did not understand the nature of microorganisms and did not understand why boiling made the drink safer-it just did", "likely, the main reason for boiling the wort was to meld the flavors and the resulting boiled wort tasted better than the wort that was not boiled", " we now understand that boiling the wort elicits several other primary functions", "it is during the wort boil that the brewer will add hops", "depending on when the hops are added to the boil, they can contribute the characteristic bitter flavor, provide the characteristic aroma, or give flavor to modern beers", "again, the brewer has many options that determine the final profile of the hops in the beer", "hops give us the crisp, citrusy flavor found in pale ales, the bitter taste of a stout, and the characteristic aroma of india pale ales (ipas)", "even in beers such as browns and porters where hops are not as pronounced, the addition of hops help increase the   106  4 overview of the brewing process  shelf life of the final product and provide a taste balance with the alcohol in the beer", "the chemistry behind the wort boil is discussed in chap", "8", " typically, a brewer will boil the wort with the first addition of hops for 60 min in order to provide the characteristic bitter flavor we associated with modern malt- based beers", "there may be other hop additions later in the boil, but at the end of the boil period no matter when the hops were added, the liquid is now called bitter wort", " an important secondary effect of boiling the wort is to increase the relative sugar content as water is evaporated from the wort", "this will eventually give us a higher alcohol content in the final beer, but with reduced volume", "another effect that occurs is the additional browning; the maillard reactions", "for the same reason that malts are toasted, this will give the beer a more robust, malty flavor (fig", "4.8)", " at the end of the boiling time, the bitter wort is pumped out of the vessel and then back into the vessel at an angle", "this creates a whirlpool", "during the whirlpool process, which can last as long as 60 min, the proteins and other coagulated materials fall to the center of the vessel forming a cone of sludge known as trub", "the bitter wort is then pumped away from this sludge and through a chiller", "as it moves through the chiller, temperature to begin fermentation", " is

liquid around in the brewery is often called racking", "so, using the brewer\u2019s vernacular, the bitter wort is racked to the fermenter", "then, the cool oxygenated bitter wort is inoculated with yeast, known as pitching yeast into the wort", " it has been said that brewers make wort, but yeast makes beer", "the importance of these microscopic fungi was not well understood in the early days of brewing", "even the german purity law, the reinheitsgebot, did not initially recognize the importance of this ingredient in the overall process", "it was not until the work of louis pasteur (1822-1895), and others, that we began to understand just how important yeast was to brewing", "the biological metabolism of sugars by yeast is quite complicated and will be discussed in detail later", "but we summarize the yeast\u2019s function from a macroscopic, if not empirical, point of view here", "the purpose of the yeast from the perspective of the brewer is to consume the sugars in the bitter wort and leave behind alcohol", " again, as in every step in the process, the brewer has a wide range of strains and species of yeast to choose from", "due to subtle differences in the metabolism of each different strains of yeast, the composition of the bitter wort, and the temperatures used by the brewer, each yeast strain will yield different by-products and impart the beer with a distinct flavor", "for example, the banana and clove flavors common to hefeweizen are due to minute by-products excreted from certain yeast strains during fermentation", "fermentation temperatures can also influence the final taste profile of the beer", " fermentation can take 2-14 days for ales, and lagers may take multiple months to complete the fermentation cycle", "during the process, the dormant yeast falls to the bottom of the vessel and is removed", "yeast falls out of the beer by flocculating", "this process, requiring calcium ions in the beer in order to be most effective, clumps the single-celled organisms together causing them to become too heavy to stay dissolved in the beer", "different yeast strains have different propensities for doing this and are often characterized by their ability to do so", "for example, highly flocculating yeasts will tend to settle and clump together very quickly after fer- mentation", "highly flocculating yeasts may need to be re-suspended in the beer (\u201croused\u201d) to complete the fermentation cycle", "on the other hand, low-flocculation yeast tends to remain in suspension", "this is the cause of the cloudiness we see in hefeweizen and some belgian style beers", "in between, medium-flocculating yeast tends to produce a cleaner beer because they stay active long enough to re-absorb diacetyl and other by-products", "they take some time, but will eventually settle to the bottom of the vessel making it easier to separate and filter from the beer", " after the fermentation cycle is complete, we have what brewers refer to as green beer", "green beer is drinkable, but the refined flavors have not stabilized", "so, the   108  4 overview of the brewing process  green beer is racked to a conditioning tank to allow that process to be accomplished", "in some cases, the fermentation tanks are pressurized allowing the carbon dioxide that is formed by the yeast to carbonate the beer", "in other cases, the tanks are open to the atmosphere and the addition or adjustment of the carbon dioxide level must be accomplished during conditioning", " checkpoint 4.4 outline as many reasons as you can why the modern brewer boils the wort before fermentation", "louis pasteur was responsible for more than just the recognition of yeast as a requirement for brewing", "what other process in food production was he responsible for (hint: the process bears his name)?  4.1.7 conditioning and bottling  at this point in the process, the green beer that we have is not very tasty", "the biological process of fermentation has produced a number of by-products such as acetaldehyde, diacetyl, and dimethyl sulfide", "combined, these flavors will give our beer an unpleasant \u201cgreen\u201d taste", "if given sufficient time, the yeast that inhabits the beer may eventually re-absorb many of these compounds, so we allow time for the product to sit and \u201ccondition.\u201d  during this period of rest dormant yeast, heavier and larger proteins, and other debris continue to precipitate from the beer", "this helps to further clarify the beer", "in the conditioning tank, the brewer also can adjust the beer", "gelatins can be added to help proteins and yeast precipitate, flavoring agents can be added to adjust the flavor, coloring agents can be added to increase the color, and reduced hop iso-acids can be added to adjust the bitterness of the beer", "each of these processes adjust the beer so that the final product is within the brewer\u2019s specifications", " bright beer refers to beer that has gone through this process and is ready to serve", "in the case of natural conditioning, the yeast will eventually settle to the bottom of the storage vessel to make bright beer", "or, the brewer could mechanically filter the beer to separate the yeast", "there are a multitude of possibilities for sep- arating proteins and yeast from the beer, including plate filters, leaf filters, and centrifuges", "unfortunately, mechanically removing the yeast before the yeast has had time to reabsorb by-products could lead to beer that is permanently out of specifications", " naturally conditioned beer takes between at least a month for ales, depending on overall alcohol content, and up to 6 months or even more for lagers", "this difference is due to the temperatures at which the yeast prefers to work", "lager yeasts grow and   4.1 overview of the process  109  ferment at cooler temperatures, so the metabolism of the by-products takes longer", "because the natural process is relatively slow, the brewer often intervenes", " since the transition from the main activity of fermentation to conditioning is very gradual, it difficult to draw a line and say when the latter starts and the former ends", "bright beer, even though it has been allowed to sit, will still have active yeast dissolved or in suspension (typical yeast counts of one million cells per milliliter are common)", "it is at the packaging point where the process is different based on the size of the brewery", "larger breweries that distribute beer across the globe will tend to filter and pasteurize their beer", "smaller microbreweries that serve at their own taproom or keg their beer for local sales tend to avoid the added expense of filtering or pasteurizing", " in cases where the beer is not filtered and pasteurized, the yeast still suspended in the bright beer will continue to condition the beer", "this greatly reduces the shelf life of the beer, as the flavors continue to change as time and temperature allow the yeast to continue their work", "the length of the shelf life is highly dependent upon the style and strength of the beer", "some imperial stouts may be naturally condi- tioned and be best for consumption in year 2 of their life", "in addition, since the beer is not pasteurized, growth of flavor-impacting bacteria and other organisms is possible", "for these reasons, commercial breweries prefer to stabilize the flavor once the flavor profile has been established by filtering and pasteurizing", "and just to be sure, many breweries also indicate the \u201cbest by\u201d date on the label to ensure that the consumer has the best experience with the product", " 4.2 cleaning and sterilizing  just as it is important to start with quality ingredients, it is imperative to maintain a clean brewery", "this is particularly true for any equipment that is used post-wort boil, since the boil will kill any microorganisms acquired during the mashing process", "the issue is that other microorganisms that are ubiquitous in nature will be just as happy consuming the fermentable sugars in the bitter wort as yeast will", "the uncontrolled fermentation by foreign microorganisms will output a significant amount of undesirable off-flavors, mouthfeel, and visual appearance", " in our casual discussion of removing unwanted microorganisms, several terms tend to be used interchangeably: sterilize, disinfect, and sanitize", "however, these have very well-defined and different definitions in the brewing and food industries", "to sterilize something means to completely kill all microorganisms", "this generally requires excessive heat applied to the brewing equipment for an extended period", "for example, a surgeon will sterilize scalpels and other operating tools in an autoclave", "unfortunately, killing all microorganisms is nearly impossible to do", "in nearly every process, some microbes survive", "disinfecting means to kill all   110  4 overview of the brewing process  unwanted microorganisms which could cause spoilage", "unfortunately, this also does not often mean that all microorganisms are eliminated", "finally, sanitization just means we will eliminate most of the unwanted organisms", " it is just not practical, or necessary, to completely sterilize brewery equipment of all indigenous, wild microorganisms", "after all, beer has been successfully brewed long before the role of yeast or other wild microorganisms were understood", "in those days, it was pure chance that a \u201cgood\u201d strain of wild yeast would inoculate the wort and start fermenting the beer", "in fact, stirring sticks from successful batches were carefully saved and reused so that a particular \u201chouse flavor\u201d would be passed to the next brew", " rather than sterilizing, we clean the brewery and equipment as best we can and sanitize with a chemical agent, eliminating most of the undesired microorganisms", "the goal of the brewer then is to get the fermentation started with our selected yeast before the other microorganisms have a chance to build a significant population", "called \u201cmicrobial antagonism,\u201d the yeast is able to build sufficient numbers such that it interferes with the normal growth of the other, undesirable microbes", "and once the level of alcohol in the beer has reached a certain level, the alcohol itself serves as an antimicrobial agent", " unfortunately, the dirtiest place in the brewery is the floor", "the floor of the brewery is always wet, walked upon by the workers, and spilled upon with sweet wort, green beer, and other compounds used in brewing", "reduction in brewery contaminants is a result of those brewers that make sure to clean the entire space where the brewery exists", "this may even include the outside walls of the brewery, and making sure that vegetation does not grow too close to the brewery itself", " safety is a significant issue that all brewers must adhere to when using chemical agents to clean the brewery", "for this reason, all brewers and workers in the brewery must know and understand the principles and processes for cleaning equipment", "for example, some chemical agents will react with carbon dioxide", "many examples exist of cleaning agents being added to a freshly emptied fermenter and seeing the reaction of carbon dioxide and cleaning agent cause the fermenter to implode", "other examples exist of untrained workers entering a vessel to clean it using toxic chemicals and expiring inside the confined space", "care and safety are necessary when using these agents", " for the safety of workers, most equipment is fitted with spray balls", "in these cases, cleaner is cycled through the vessels using a pump that pushes the liquid through a spray ball", "the result is known as clean-in-place (cip)", "this allows the brewer to clean a vessel in the shortest amount of time possible, while reducing the exposure of workers to harmful chemicals", "  4.3 inputs and outputs  111  checkpoint 4.5 assume the brewer wishes to not clean the boil kettle between batches of beer", "describe what you might expect to happen to the beer in later batches", "outline at least three things that the brewer could adjust in the conditioning phase of the beer", " 4.3 inputs and outputs  the most important part of brewing is making sure that the ingredients used in the process are the highest quality that they can be", "in essence, a good beer can arise from good ingredients", "it is very difficult to make a good beer from inferior ingredients", " 4.3.1 water  in the past, brewing ingredients and procedures were developed using local ingredients", "this is still true today considering the first main ingredient, water", "by percent volume of the final product, water is the most significant ingredient in beer, and, with the largest total weight, an ingredient that is difficult to ship from place to place", "so even today, brewers source their main ingredient locally", "since clean water by itself has very little taste, it is easy to overlook the contribution of water as an ingredient", "but just as one must \u201cplant the seeds\u201d to start with quality grain, one must also consider the importance of water", "we will look more closely at water and its makeup in sect", "5.4", " early brewing culture drew water from the ground (well water) or from the surface (lakes, streams, springs, rivers, etc.)", "as it happens, groundwater contains a significant amount of dissolved salts and minerals from the surrounding bedrock- all of this depending on the geology of the area", "it is quite fortuitous that many of the naturally dissolved minerals contributing to the hardness of groundwater are essential for brewing", " owing to the different geology of different areas, brewing evolved differently depending on the water chemistry in the area", "for example, regions with higher levels of bicarbonate, such as london or dublin, are known for their darker beers", "high levels of bicarbonates tend to make the ph of the water too high, affecting both mash efficiency and yeast metabolism", "adding highly roasted grain-darker   112  4 overview of the brewing process  roasted malt-tends to lower the ph back to the optimum acidic values", "so, by accident or by trial and error, the brewers with this type of water who brewed darker beers such as porters and stouts noticed that the beer tasted very good", "this style of beer is appropriate for the local water chemistry", "on the other hand, the water from wells near burton-on-trent is high in gypsum (calcium sulfate)", "and coincidentally, this type of water is very efficient at enhancing hop aromas and flavors", "thus, the early brewers in burton-on-trent developed a very characteristic pale ale", " early brewers brewed beers appropriate for their local water chemistry", "today, we have the option to start with purified water, obtained by either distillation or reverse osmosis (ro), and adding measured amounts of minerals and salts appropriate for the beer to be brewed", "in the brewery, this means that city-provided water is often treated prior to its use", "or, a brewer can start with water that is available, either from a well or from a municipality, and make small corrections", "however, an accurate accounting of the starting water chemistry is required", "one step is clear, though", "city water supplies that are treated with chlorine, fluoride, or other compounds must be treated at the brewery to remove these agents", "in addition to their ability to alter the flavor of the finished product, the action of some of the disinfecting agents during the brewing process can result in the formation of potential cancer-causing agents", "no brewer wants to make beer with that on the label", " 4.3.2 grains and malts  the maltster provides the brewer with a large selection of malts to use in designing a beer", "the variety of flavors available to the brewer is primarily due to the process used to dry and roast the malts, and to some extent the species (2-row or 6-row) and cultivar of grain used", "we will consider the basic process differences and the type of malt each yields in this section", "in fig", "4.9, the overall processes and the products that are produced by each are outlined", "roasted barley the first distinction comes by examining fig", "4.9", "roasted barley is simply barley that was toasted, almost burnt, without executing the malting process", "the kilning at very high temperatures not only denatures the saccharifi- cation enzymes, but browns and burns the starches originally in the grain", "roasted barley is not malt; this ingredient is used sparingly for adding a dry roasted, distinct coffee-like flavor", "it also adds a significant amount of color to the final beer", "roasted barley is frequently used in stouts and some porters", " pale malt on the other hand, pale malt has undergone the basic malting process by germinating the grain in the presence of water", "the malting process starts the process of saccharification, as well as the development of needed enzymes", "the growing process is halted by drying the malt", "typically, the malt is dried at around 100 \u00b0f (40 \u00b0c) with very high levels of ventilation", "this drying step rapidly removes the water but does little to damage the enzymes in the malt", "once the water content reaches about 10 %, the malted grain is cured by raising the temperature to   4.3 inputs and outputs  113  fig", "4.9 schema for producing a wide variety of malts from a single type of grain  about 175 \u00b0f (80 \u00b0c) with continued ventilation", "the drying process is monitored by measuring the temperature of the air pushed into the grain (air on) and com- paring it to the temperature of the air that passes out of the grain (air off)", "once the temperature of the air on and air off becomes the same, the malt is considered cured", "typically, this leaves about 4 % moisture in the malt (fig", "4.10)", " different cultivars, slightly different temperatures, and the amount of ventilation will yield different malts such as pilsner malt and vienna malt", "the main point here is that the temperature used to dry the grain is low enough that the scarification enzymes are not denatured", "the grain is said to have sufficient diastatic power needed to convert starches into sugars during the mash process", "  114  4 overview of the brewing process  fig", "4.10 2-row pale malt  a grain bill must contain a significant amount of grain with diastatic power to execute the starch-sugar conversion", "a grain used for this purpose is frequently called the base grain and makes up 70-95 % of the grain bill", "munich and vienna malts are initially dried at slightly higher temperatures with much lower amounts of ventilation", "then, they are cured at slightly higher temperatures than pale malt", "this process helps protect most of the enzymes, but the higher temperatures increase the number of maillard reactions", "they have a darker, richer flavor and are an ideal base grain for bock or oktoberfest styles", "since they are dried at a higher tem- perature, they do not have as much diastatic power as pale malt, but enough that they can still be used as the base grain", " dark malts dark malts, such as brown malt and chocolate malt, have been kilned at higher temperatures", "again, a variety of temperatures are responsible for the biggest differences in these types of malts", "the freshly dried pale malt is first cured at the standard pale malt temperature and then kilned typically in a drum roaster at higher temperatures", "the higher temperatures increase the rate of malliard reactions inside the malt and begin to change the flavor of the grain", " malliard reactions, as we discovered in sect", "3.3, are non-enzymatic browning reactions initiated by the condensation of amino acids and sugars in the grain", "the products of the reaction are increased amounts of nitrogen and oxygen heterocycles and the formation of melanoidins", "the process gives very distinct enhanced flavors and a significant increase in the intensity of brown colors", " while the elevated temperatures enhance the malty, biscuit-like flavors, this also denatures the enzymes and makes them unable to perform the reactions needed in the mashing process", "thus, these malts have very little diastatic power", "this is primarily why these malts are not used as a base grain", "furthermore, a beer made exclusively with brown or chocolate malt would have a very strong and unbalanced taste profile (fig", "4.11)", "  4.3 inputs and outputs  fig", "4.11 chocolate malt", "the name of the malt arises from the color of the malt, not from the flavor", "although the use of this malt does increase the chocolaty flavors in a brew  115  crystal malts crystal malts initially skip the drying step in malting", "as soon as the germination of the barley is complete, the wet grain is placed in a rotating drum and heated to about 150 \u00b0f (65 \u00b0c) for 30 min", "during this initial heating, additional water is sprayed onto the malt", "this is the normal temperature for conducting a mash, so it is like conducting a miniature mash right inside the barley seed", "the result is that the enzymes in the grain become activated and convert the starches of the malt into sugars", "once the process has completed, the temperature is increased to 300 \u00b0f (150 \u00b0c) and the malt is ventilated for an hour or more", "this higher temperature caramelizes some of the sugars and increases the flavors of toffee, caramel, and brown sugar", "this also increases the maillard reactions that further enhance the flavor and color of the malt", " the amount of time that the malt is left at 300 \u00b0f (150 \u00b0c) determines the level of browning that occurs", "in this way, the maltster can prepare lightly colored crystal malts (known as crystal 10l) or even very dark crystal malts (such as crystal 90l) (fig", "4.12)", " fig", "4.12 crystal 40l malt", "note the exposed

that none remain", "these malts have no diastatic power", "however, because the starches in these grains have been converted into fermentable sugar, crystal malts do not need to be mashed", "the brewer can add them to the mash, but this is often just done to help increase the permeability of the filter bed when the mash is sparged", "it is entirely possible that the brewer could simply steep the crystal malts in warm water to extract the sugars and add that directly to the sweet wort", " checkpoint 4.6 is it possible for the temperature of the air off to be lower than the tem- perature of

hops", "these historical recipes, however, often used additives to spice up the brew so that it was not so one-dimensional in flavor", "many different plants, herbs, fruits, vegetables, and spices found their way into the recipe", "the list is quite extensive but includes ingredients such as heather flowers, bog myrtle, dandelion, and spruce needles", "as we noted in chap", "1, the use of gruit was common in europe", "and while hops were used in beers as early as the 800\u2019s, it was not until the thirteenth century that hops saw consistent use as a flavoring agent", "yet, in britain, hops were condemned as a \u201cwicked and pernicious weed\u201d and ale, a drink made exclusively from water, malt, and yeast, was the preferred beverage", "it was not until the mid-fifteenth century that beer was accepted as a drink in england; and until the mid-eighteenth century, the words ale and beer meant entirely different drinks", "the prevalence of the use of hops in beer is tied to both the pleasant flavor it produces and to the preservative power of the hops (beer would last longer)", " the hop plant (humulus lupulus) is a climbing, herbaceous perennial, in the family cannabaceae", "although it looks like a vine, it is actually a bine", "the dif- ference is in how the stem of the plant attaches itself to structures as it grows", "a bine grows helically around its support and has downward pointing bristles to help it climb, while a vine uses tendrils and suckers to attach to the support as it climbs", "incidentally, hops are very closely related to cannabis (marijuana) in the relatively small cannabaceae family", "the hop plant is also dioecious meaning that it   4.3 inputs and outputs  117  has distinct male and female plants", "the flower that the female plant produces is the most desirable for brewing", "but once that flower has been pollinated by the male plant, it begins to produce seeds", "the production of seeds greatly reduces the utility of the flowers for use in brewing, so, the hop farmer works to make sure that only the female plant is grown in the field", "while seeds do allow the plant to propagate, so too does the growth of the underground rhizome", " the rhizome of the hop plant is essentially a stem that grows beneath the surface of the soil", "from the rhizome are perennial roots that can survive throughout the year, and in the spring, buds on the rhizome send annual shoots above the soil", "cuttings from the rhizome allow a genetically identical hop plant to be produced without use of pollination", "each year, the annual shoots rapidly grow from the rhizome during the spring and once they reach a given length, convert their growth spurt into the production of strobiles, also called cones", " the female hop cone

which the endosperm is modified by the action of water and enzymes is very important", "if only a portion of the endosperm is modified, the resulting malt is considered partially modified", "if all of the endosperm is modified, the malt is considered fully modified", "fully modified malt is squishy and spongy to the touch-a good indicator that the endosperm\u2019s cell walls have been broken down", "partially modified malt contains a hard nib inside the malt that is not broken down by the enzymes", "this becomes very important in mashing as the fully modified malt can be easily converted into fermentable sugars", "the partially modified malt must undergo additional processing during the mash in order to be completely converted into fermentable sugars", " more importantly, partially modified endosperms have a significantly larger amount of \u03b2-glucan remaining", "this carbohydrate that makes up a portion of the endosperm cell walls causes some problems for the brewer unless it is taken care of during malting", "of primary concern is that it makes the grain bed during mashing much less permeable, a problem that can give rise to a stuck mash", "in addition, the large amount of \u03b2-glucan in the mash can translate into haze in the finished beer", "the proteins that make up the cell walls and surround the starch granules are broken down into amino acids by proteases",

globulins are smaller proteins that tend to be more water soluble than the glutelins and hordeins", "  5.2 malting barley  135  high levels of protease activity initially seem like they would be a good thing to have happen because higher levels of fan would be beneficial to the yeast later in the process", "however, this is not the case", "if the level of fan is too great, the amount of maillard reactions (the heat driven reactions of amino acids and sugars) increases", "this can result in significantly more browning and caramelization than desired", "in addition, if too many of the proteins are broken down, the result is a loss of the head on the beer", "the combination of proteins, tannins, and other compounds is needed to support a full head of foam", " if the level of protease action is too low, many of the proteins will not break down", "this results in problems with haze and foam later in the process", "it also results in a lower than usual conversion of the starches into fermentable sugars during the mash", "high protein levels can result in a more viscous wort during mashing, increasing the risk of a potentially stuck mash", "finally, the foam generated during the initial stages of the boil can be quite significant meaning additional care must be taken prior to the hot break", "in short, it is very important to have adequate protein degradation", " the end result of all of these steps is the growth of the barley seed", "initially, the maltster notes the emergence of the chit from the bottom of the seed", "this will eventually develop into the roots as the seed continues to grow", "the maltster also notes the growth of the acrospire that eventually will become the shoot for the plant", "the acrospire grows from the embryo under the dorsal husk of the seed toward the distal end", "basically, it is not seen during the initial stages of growth-but if a seed is pulled apart, the acrospire can be readily observed", " the maltster stops the growth of the seed as soon as the acrospire is approxi- mately the same length as the entire seed", "by this time, the roots are about two-times the length of the seed", "this amount of growth is required for the endosperm to become fully modified", "if stopped too early, the malt would be partially modified", "if the maltster does not arrest the growth of the seed when the acrospire is as long as the seed, the level of starch in the endosperm would continue to drop as the seed grows and the utility of the seed to be used in making beer would be reduced", " to stop the growth, the maltster applies heat and dries out the seeds slowly until they are almost free of moisture", "the dehydrated seed cannot continue growth and the enzymes are unable to continue to act on the starch and cell walls", "the enzymes are, for the most part, still active", "they just lack the water to allow them to do their work", "at this point, the malt can be kilned to add color or flavor to the malt itself", " 5.2.2 equipment used in malting  in the previous section, we uncovered what happens inside the barley seed as it undergoes the malting process", "the maltster uses some specialized equipment to ensure that the process is efficient, rapid, and uniform across an entire batch of barley", "special attention is placed on making the process uniform", "deviations from uniformity result in partially, fully, and over modified malt", "such malts would be   136  5 the \u201cfood\u201d for the brew  difficult to handle in the brewhouse and would lower the mash efficiency for the brewer",

the barley does not \u201cdrown\u201d, oxygen bubbles through the mixture", "the action of the gas in the vat helps to stir the mixture", "unfortunately, this leaves areas in the vat that have significantly more oxygen exposure than other areas", "the stirring action of bubbling gas tends not to mix very efficiently either", "so, the maltster has developed a more efficient steeping tank", "this tank looks very similar to the cylindroconical vessels (ccvs) that are used as fermentation tanks", "however, the interior of these vessels belies their difference", "figure 5.8 illustrates a drawing of a cutaway view of the modern steep tank", "the sloped bottom and internal baffles force the slurry of water and barley to mix thoroughly", "this provides adequate water and oxygen uniformly to the barley seeds", " the steeping of the barley is adjusted by the maltster to allow even hydration", "often this includes periods of soaking in water, periods of bubbling oxygen through the water, and periods of resting (where the water is drained)", "it is very important that the soaking cycles include cycles of resting", "resting allows the removal of co2 and waste products from the barley as it grows", "resting also is important because it allows the barley to be washed of foreign substances and bacteria", " the barley seeds generate heat as they absorb water and swell in size",

movement turns the barley as it grows", "by the time the barley has reached the end of the device, it is fully modified", " as the grain germinates, controlling the temperature of the grain becomes more difficult", "for this reason, the maltster allows the grain to dry out a little in a process known as withering", "the control of germination can also be accomplished by increasing the amount of co2 that is added to the air passing through the grain", "this slows the respiration of the grain and reduces its growth rate", "a slower growth rate allows the maltster to more carefully gauge when

forced to use water supplied from their town", "across the usa, cities and towns get their water from surface and ground water supplies as needed", "some towns pull water from nearby lakes, some from rivers and streams, some dig wells, and others use reverse osmosis to grab water from oceans", "in fact, larger towns and cities may obtain water from multiple sources", "it all depends on where the closest water supply exists", " thus, the water delivered to a brewery is highly dependent upon the location of the brewery", "in addition, if the city uses multiple sources for their water, the source may be different from season to season", "of greater impact, however, is that the water obtained from municipalities is often treated to ensure that no harmful pathogens or ions exist", "to ensure a safe water supply, most municipalities add chemicals", " water purification often begins by adding compounds such as aluminum sulfate or iron(iii) chloride", "these compounds react with water to make aluminum hydroxide or iron(iii) hydroxide", "the hydroxide salts coagulate and entrap organic solids as they precipitate from the water", "the sulfate and chloride ions that remain in the solution raise the overall concentration of these ions a little, but the removal of the suspended matter is more beneficial", " the purification plant then adds a disinfectant to the water to reduce

grains by filtration", "tradi- tionally, draining the liquid from the grains using a process known as batch sparging did this", "while the batch sparge process is not used as much anymore, some brewers recognize the usefulness of the parti-gyle method for beer production", "modern techniques include the use of fly sparging and the mash filter", " the purpose of these different techniques is to completely remove the fermentable sugars from the residual grains", "the efficiency of the process is of paramount con- cern to the brewer, because any loss of fermentable sugars results in a decrease in the potential quality of the finished beer (and a concomitant decrease in profit)", " 7.4.1 batch sparging  batch sparging is typically accomplished by simply draining the liquid from the grains", "some brewers continue to use this process today, but it was much more   216  7 sparging  common in the early days of brewing", "in this process, the first batch of liquid drains slowly from the mash and is then returned to the top of the mash", "this process is continued until the wort is clear (known as the vorlauf)", "after the liquid draining from the mash is clear, the liquid is collected in the underback (also known as the grant)", "this collection vessel is typically located underneath the tun and has mul- tiple drain holes from the mash directly into the underback", "the grant is a spe- cialized version of this piece of equipment that fills with the drained liquid", "the volume of the liquid in the grant is maintained to ensure that the pressure of the filtration can be monitored", "if the difference in the height of the liquid in the grant and the height of the liquid in the mash tun gets too great, the brewer can slow down the removal of the liquid from the grant or turn on the mash rakes to increase the flow rate", " at this point, after all of the liquid has been removed (the first runnings), the flow of liquid across the grain bed is stopped and another batch of hot liquor is added to the mash tun", "often the entire bed is mixed, stirred, and then allowed to resettle", "mixing is important because it allows the new hot liquor to rinse the grains and extract any sugars from the grains", "then, the process of running the liquid through the underback or grant is repeated", "this second batch of wort (the second runnings) can either be added to the first or treated separately as a different beer", "the process is often repeated a third time", "by the end of the third runnings, there are very little sugars left in the grains", " the equipment used for the batch sparge is often the same as that used for the mash", "in other words, the mash tun can double as the lauter tun when the batch sparge is performed", "alternatively, the entire mash can be pumped (grain and liquor) into a lauter tun to perform the batch sparge", "the benefit is the same as that which is described in the subsequent section on fly sparging", " each of the drainings (or runnings) in a batch sparge operation is known as a gyle", "these worts were evaluated for the concentration of sugars and then mixed to provide different beers", "the mixing and the overall process of doing so were referred to as parti-gyle brewing", "the strongest (and first draining of the wort) has the greatest maltose content and can be used to make export beer, barleywine, or strong ale", "the weakest and last drainings of the wort can be used (historically this was the case) to make small beer-a lower alcohol beer that was consumed reg- ularly by everyone in the family", " parti-gyle brewing is not performed much anymore, but there are some com- mercial brewers who have reconsidered this process as a viable method for creating a wide variety of beers from a single wort stream", " 7.4.2 fly sparging  in this process, which we discussed at length in the bulk of this chapter, hot liquor is added to the mash as the wort is removed from the mash", "again, the goal is to remove all of the fermentable sugars", "a special sparge arm is employed to add the additional hot liquor without disturbing the bed of grains", "again, the first runnings   7.4 equipment

commercially", "in the simplest system, the mash tun serves as the location for the process", "if the mash tun is equipped with stir paddles, these are stopped and held in place during the sparge", "a layer of water at least 2-5 cm (1-2 in.) thick is placed on top of the spent grains and the liquid slowly drained out of the system", "additional hot liquor is added at the same rate that it is removed so that the pressure differential across the bed of grain is kept small", "the first of the sparge water that is added during the sparge must be at about the same temperature as the mash during mash-out", "after about half of the wort has been removed, the sparge water can be traded out for room temperature water", "studies have shown that no benefit is obtained by sparging with hot liquor during the entire sparge", " in more efficient processes, the entire mash is pumped into a much wider tun that resembles the mash tun, but is often fitted with rakes rather than stir paddles (see fig", "7.21)", "the wider lauter tun allows the thickness of the grain bed to be sig- nificantly reduced", "this allows the sparging process to take place faster (with a higher flow rate) while keeping the pressure differential across the bed the same as it would be in the mash tun", "design of the mash rakes often used in the lauter tun indicates that their shape and dimensions can seriously impact the extraction effi- ciency during the sparge", "often the rakes have metal triangles placed at angles along the rake", "the rakes are also not simply straight; they are bent into a zigzag pattern from top to bottom", "the design of the rakes allows maximum effect in increasing the bed permeability", "these mash rakes are employed if the pressure differential begins to increase at the flow rates employed", "this is simply done by rotating the rakes around the grain bed", "in some systems, the rakes can be raised  fig", "7.21 lauter tun versus the mash tun for sparging   218

pressure (in kpa) can be determined  and lowered allowing even more control over the effect of the rakes on the process of sparging", " the sweet wort that exits the fly sparging setup is usually emptied immediately into the underback or grant", "as we noted before, the grant collects all of the wort across the entire bottom of the lauter tun or mash tun and fills slowly", "visually, the difference in the heights of the liquid in the grant and the level of the liquid in the mash/lauter tun can be compared (see fig", "7.22)", "in doing so, the pressure across the grain bed can be either estimated or calculated (if the difference in heights is measured.) this is done to verify that the pressure does not exceed the capabilities of the false bottom", "too high and the false bottom can buckle under the pressure", "in addition, the difference can be used to verify the flow rate of the wort being removed from the vessel", " 7.4.3 mash filter  the most efficient extraction of fermentable sugars occurs with the use of the mash filter", "this process also requires that the grist is much more finely ground", "in fact, it is often ground to the point where it resembles flour", "in these systems, the mash is much thicker and first runnings of the wort after removal from the mash can be greater than 24 \u00b0p", "the efficiency of the mash filter drives its usage in the brewing industry", " when a mash filter is used, the entire mash resembles a thick porridge", "malt flour is added to the hot liquor in a mash mixer", "the flour can be added directly to the hot liquor, or as is done with the ground grist using a lauter tun, a premash mixer is often employed", "constant mixing during the mash aids in the conversion of starches into fermentable sugars", "just as with the other systems, care must be taken to avoid high shear forces that can destroy the proteins and other compounds in the mixture", "once the mash is complete, the entire mixture is pumped

bladders are deflated (iv) and rinse water is added", "the mash and sparge water are resqueezed (v) to remove the 2nd runnings", "the process is repeated multiple times to remove all fermentable sugars from the mash  apparatus and then squeezed with bladders to push the wort away from the flour (fig", "7.23)", "hot liquor is added to the pressed flour and the mash is resqueezed", "the wort is collected and passed along to the boil kettle", " use of the mash filter allows extraction efficiencies to approach or even be better than theoretical yields", "after rinsing the flour and resqueezing, the apparatus is opened and the almost \u201cdry\u201d spent grains are released", "this process, too, can be automated, dropping the spent grains onto a conveyor belt and removing them from the system", " while this seems like it might be a rather new technology in mashing, the meura mash filter, one of the hallmark versions of the mash filter, was actually invented in 1901 by phillippe meura", "the success of the apparatus has ensured its place in the brewing industry", "slight improvements since then have been made, but the basic apparatus has been used since then", " the apparatus looks like a typical plate-and-frame filter (which we will discuss later in this text)", "basically, a series of bladders are bolted together in a tall rect- angular shape", "the success of the filter in improving efficiency of extraction has resulted in its use across the world", "in fact, this system is responsible for the production of more than one-third of all the beer consumed annually", " 7.5 when do we stop sparging?  hot liquor used in sparging should be hot (about 80 \u00b0c or 175 \u00b0f)", "the temperature is extremely important in the initial stages of this process", "keeping the temperature hot continues to denature the proteins and destroy the enzymatic activity", "in   220  7 sparging  addition, the hot water aids in the extraction of the fermentable sugars from the remnants of the grains", "as we noted earlier, some research has been done on the use of sparge water with different temperatures", "those studies have shown that only about one-third volume of hot liquor is needed", "any remaining sparge water need not be heated to continue and conclude the sparging process", "in spite of this information, it is very common for the brewer to maintain the hot temperatures during the entire process", "in most cases, the addition energy required to heat the volume of water to that temperature does not seriously impact the brewer\u2019s

pumping action helps to keep any fouling of the copper tubes to a minimum", "this advantage is clear when one considers that about 10 heating cycles (10 batches of beer) can be performed before the calandria must be cleaned", "also, because the wort is pumped into the calandria, the boil kettle need not be full in order to begin the heating process", "to aid in appropriate trub formation, the pumping action can be stopped once the wort is at boiling temperature", "the wort at this temperature will ther- mosiphon through the external calandria", " by far, the biggest advantage to the use of the external calandria is that the evaporation of water from the wort can be reduced to about 5 % per hour while still preserving the necessary reductions in volatile organic compounds such as dms", "

down a steam-heated cone on the inside of the heating vessel", "the greatly increased surface area of the wort in contact with the hot cone allows for very efficient evaporation of the wort", "then, after dripping off of the cone, the heated wort is pumped back into the whirlpool vessel to settle", " the wort is injected at an angle on the whirlpool vessel such that the entire contents of the vessel are mixed", "the swirling action of the wort causes the trub to move to the middle of the vessel and precipitate", "thus, the trub is removed from the wort while it is being heated", " evaporation rates in the merlin\u00ae system are very low (*4 %) but contain the same or better reduction in volatile organic compounds", "and thorough heating and mixing of the wort occurs with each portion of the wort passing over the heating cone 5-6 times", "because the system is coupled with the whirlpool, minimal time is needed to remove the trub from the wort at the end of the boil", "

be viewed as the kinetic energy of individual molecules and atoms", "when we think of a container of gas, we envision the indi- vidual molecules moving around, bouncing off each other and the walls of the container", "each molecule will have an individual speed, and therefore a kinetic energy", "a similar concept is held for solids if we view the atoms or molecules connected with each other by small springs", "each atom vibrates, and due to this motion, they will have an associated kinetic energy", "of course, the atoms in a solid are not connected by springs; however, the forces involved between neighboring atoms that hold them together into a solid are similar in concept", " it would be very difficult to describe an object\u2019s thermal energy by measuring or reporting the

are only relative to some other temperatures", "but if we consider the atomic model of solids, liquids, or gases, these words would then refer to the average kinetic energy or motion of the atoms", " so what would happen if we place a hot object next to a cold object? the thermal motion of the neighboring atoms will start to cause the \u201ccold\u201d atoms to vibrate, transferring energy to the

materials", " 8.4 heat capacity and heat transfer  when thermal energy is transferred to an object, the observed temperature change will depend on how much of the material is present", "it will also depend on the type of material", "the term specific heat capacity addresses how different materials might have different capabilities to store or give up thermal energy", " as an analogy, let us consider two towels used to absorb a spill", "a chamois towel can hold considerably more water than a similarly sized kitchen towel", "we might say that the kitchen towel has a smaller \u201cwater capacity\u201d than the chamois towel", "its also reasonable to say that as the size of the towel increases the more water it can absorb", "for towels, the ability to absorb and store water depends on both the type of material and the size of the towel", " likewise, when thermal energy is transferred to or from an object, factors that determine the total amount of energy transferred are the mass of the object, the temperature change, and a constant that depends on the type of material that makes up the object", "this constant is called the specific heat capacity (c)", " the definition of specific heat capacity (or just specific heat) is the amount of thermal energy required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of the object by one degree celsius", "for water, that value is 4.184 j/g

that it would take the addition of 4184 j of heat to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1 \u00b0c", "the addition of the same amount of heat to iron would result in a much greater temperature change for the iron", "and as we discovered earlier, a larger change in the temperature of the metal can mean that it is able to transfer some thermal energy to the liquid that touches it", " another important unit a brewer often encounters is the btu (british thermal unit)", "this, just like the joule, is a unit used to measure heat", "one btu is equivalent to 1055 j", "burners are often characterized by the rate at which they transfer energy", "in other words, they are rated by the ability to produce a certain number of btu per hour", "although it is common to see an advertisement

steam?  at the boiling point of a liquid, energy that is added into the system is used to convert the liquid into a gaseous vapor", "the temperature of the liquid does not change during that process,

this vital ingredient, the biology of the plant itself and its structure, and how it contributes to the flavor of a beer is very important to understanding the science of brewing", " 8.5.1 the hop flower revisited  the female hop plant is the source of the pinecone-shaped flower that a brewer knows as a hop cone", "the male plant is responsible for pollination of these cones, but once it has done so, greatly reduces the quantity and quality of the oils found inside the flower", "for that reason, the hop farmer abhors the male plants and does everything possible to eliminate them from the field", " hops, humulus lupulus, are an example of a bine", "they grow on the farm by extending an annual shoot into the air", "that shoot has gripping structures that help it climb by wrapping around

water, minerals (such as nickel, zinc, and magnesium), tannins, lipids, sugars, volatile oils, and alpha acids and beta acids", " volatile oils the volatile oils include chemical compounds known as terpenes and sesquiterpenes in addition to hundreds of other constituents", "these compounds impart odors and flavors associated with the hop flower itself", "a key terpene found in hops is myrcene

compounds in the hop oils", "these compounds can be broken into two main categories (monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes.) oxidation and maturing of the hop oil often result in a wide variety of partially oxidized comounds", "some common oxidized monoterpenes are shown here", "note the similarities between each structure   252  8 wort boiling  many of the volatile oils have undergone oxidation in the air to form other compounds, such as geraniol (rose-like or flowery aroma), limonene (lemony aroma), and linalool (flowery aroma)", "in some hop varieties, the oxidation of the volatile oils has resulted in compounds with cucumber, balsamic, or mushroom-like aromas", "in over oxidized, or old hops, these compounds continue to change their structures into compounds that have an \u201cold cheese\u201d or \u201cpaper\u201d aroma", " since the volatile oils are volatile, if the brewer adds them to the boiling wort at the start of the boil, most of the oils will be removed with the

they would wait until the last minute to add the hops to the hot wort (or add them after the wort has been cooled back to room temperature.)  humulones another class of compounds found in the oils from the hop cone are the humulones, also known as the \u03b1-acids (fig", "8.11)", "these compounds are prized by the brewer and the hop farmer", "in fact, specific cultivars of hops are grown and nurtured to produce extremely high contents of these compounds", "they are the compounds that undergo conversion to the bitterness and protective compounds desired in the finished beer", " the general structure of the humulones is illustrated in fig", "8.10", "three main humulones have been identified that differ in the chain of carbon atoms extending from the central six-membered ring", "these

suggests that presence of the minerals found in the hop cones and in the malt, as the reaction does not proceed if humulone is heated by itself", "in any case, the six-membered ring opens during the reaction and the molecule rearranges to a more stable confor- mation", "the ring then closes, but as a five-membered ring system", "the result is the formation of cis-isohumulone and trans-isohumulone roughly in a 2:1 ratio depending upon the conditions of the boiling wort (see fig", "8.12)", " the resulting compounds are also known as cis- and trans-iso-\u03b1-acids", "the iso-alpha acids are intensely bitter and much more soluble in wort than the alpha acids", "unfortunately, though, there is a limit to their solubility that depends upon the amount of maltose, sucrose, and other sugars in the wort", "about 100-120 ppm iso-alpha acids appears to be the maximum that can be dissolved", "this is not an issue, because the human taste threshold has a hard time telling the difference between bitterness at this level", " in order for the reaction to take place, heat and time are needed", "therefore, the brewer must add the hops at the start of the boil", "the longer the hops are in contact with the hot wort, the more of the reaction takes place, and the more bitterness that gets imparted to the finished beer", "it should be noted that if the brewer wants both bitterness and aroma, multiple additions of the hops should be done during the boil", "the only drawback is that even with prolonged (>60 min) boiling, it is difficult to achieve more than about 35-40 % conversion of the humulone to isohumulone (known as the \u201cutilization rate\u201d)", " lupulones in addition to the humulones are a class of compound with a very similar structure known as the lupulones or

the humulones in that they cannot undergo the ring contraction reaction", "in addition, they are not very bitter at all and contribute little to the flavor or aroma of the hops, unless they are oxidized", " the main use for the lupulones is that they can signal whether the hop is a \u201cnoble\u201d hop or a \u201cbittering\u201d hop", "ratios of the humulone and lupulone of about 1:1 indicate a noble hop variety", "this can be confirmed by a hop oil containing less than 50 % myrcene and a humulene to caryophylene ratio of at least 3:1", " overall flavor and aroma it is the combination of all of the different compounds that give rise to the flavor and aroma of a particular hop oil", "with only slight modification of the percentages of the different compounds, the flavor

confirm that the hops being purchased match the characteristics that are desired", " 8.5.3 modified hop oils  because the conversion of humulone to isohumulone is time-consuming, low yield, and can cause adverse effects in the brew, the brewer may look to a commercial product that provides the same outcome without the use of hops", "research on hop oils and the conversion of alpha acids revealed that the procedure can be completed in the laboratory with excellent efficiency and yield", "the result is the modified hop oil", " one modification is to extract the hop oils from the plant material and use the oil directly", "this hop extract allows the brewer to reduce the amount of waste products and trub during the boil", "the hop oil, when added to the boil, is a little more efficient at the isomerization reaction and can equate to about a 40-45 % utilization rate", " another modification involves the laboratory-based conversion of the humulone to isohumulone in the hop oil extract", "the resulting preisomerized hop oil is nearly 100 % utilized, resulting in a bittering liquid that can be added directly to the wort or to the finished beer", "this product is often used to adjust the bitterness of the beer to move the product into the correct specifications for the style", " other modifications include treatment of the preisomerized hop oil to make either a dihydro, tetrahydro, or hexahyrdo-isomerized oil (fig", "8.13)", "addition of   8.5 hops in the boil  255  hydrogen atoms using chemical reagents such as sodium borohydride (nabh4) or hydrogen gas (h2) allow the hop producer

to the reaction of light with beer (eliminating the \u201cskunked\u201d flavor associated with a beer left out in the sun)", "the tetrahydro-isohumulones, where the double bonds have been removed from the molecule, increase the ability of the hop oils to support a thick foam on top of the beer", "the hexahydro-isohumulones have both the prop- erties of a light-stable hop oil and an enhanced foam on the finished beer", " as we have noted in this section, the structure of a molecule plays a large role in the properties (such as flavor) of the molecule", "and, as we would expect, the bitterness of the reduced isomerized compounds is not exactly the same as before", "so care must be taken by the brewer to add just the right amount of these com- pounds to give the desired flavor for the finished

relatively easy to clean and is not reactive with the somewhat acidic wort and beer that we pump through the system", "moreover, since stainless steel is stronger than copper, we can make the

on either side is well mixed, so we do not worry about heat conduction through the water", "we also assume that there is no heat conduction to the rest of the world", "finally, to answer this

temperature hits the lowest end of the range, even the yeast cells fall out of solution", "thus, the lagering process, once complete, results in a very clear beer", " in some cases, the beer at the end of the primary fermentation process requires a boost of yeast in order to continue the fermentation process", "in these cases, two options are available for the brewer", "in one option, a separate strain of yeast can be pumped into the green beer and allowed to ferment again", "this may be the option chosen if the primary yeast strain used is unable to continue the fermentation of all of the remaining sugars", "for example, if the brewer were interested in making a very high alcohol beer and the first fermentation was accomplished with a standard yeast, the addition of a more robust yeast might be needed to finish off the rest of the fermentable sugars", "if the beer will be lagered with the additional yeast, the   10.1 why condition?  315  secondary yeast strain is often one that can handle the lower temperatures during the maturation process", " alternatively, a portion of the wort from an actively fermenting batch of wort may be used to inoculate the beer in the secondary fermenter", "this process is called kr\u00e4usening", "most commonly used in the lagering process, the addition of kr\u00e4usen (the yeast laden foam on an actively fermenting wort) can help mature the flavor of the cold green beer quickly because a very large bolus of fresh yeast is added to the beer", " 10.1.2 warm conditioning  at the end of primary fermentation, the brewer may decide to speed up the action of the yeast on the beer", "in these cases, the brewer warms the beer from the standard fermentation temperature by about 5 \u00b0c (9 \u00b0f) and holds it at that temperature for a period of time", "as the temperature increases, the reactions inside the yeast proceed faster", "thus, the yeast cells work harder to uptake the remaining fermentable sugars", "and when those sugars are depleted, the yeast uptakes other compounds that can provide energy", "one of the more important classes of compounds that are consumed by the yeast when the fermentable sugars have been consumed is the vdks (vicinal diketones)", "the main vdks in question are diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione com- pounds that have a flavor threshold that is quite low", "for this reason, warm con- ditioning is also known as the \u201cdiacetyl rest.\u201d  the speed of the process is the main reason why a brewer often chooses this method to clean the flavors in the finished beer", "the same result can be obtained at lower temperatures (i.e., the reduction of the levels of diacetyl, 2,3-pentanedione, and other off-flavor compounds), but the process occurs much slower", "typically, if a beer is cold conditioned, it may require multiple days, weeks, or even months in order to accomplish the same thing that happens in 12-24 h at the elevated temperature", " diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione concentrations begin to rise at the end of the rapid growth phase of the yeast during fermentation (see fig", "10.1)", "diacetyl arises from the production of \u03b1-acetolactate during the

upon the composition of the wort and the temperature of the system", "for example, if the wort has a high-fan content, the production of \u03b1-acetolactate is limited", "if the levels of valine and isoleucine in the wort are large, their presence suppresses the formation of the precursors to make them (i.e., \u03b1-acetolactate)", "higher fermentation temper- atures also have a positive impact on diacetyl production", " warm conditioning takes place when the temperature of the fermenter is adjusted after the rapid growth phase of the yeast (fig", "10.2)", "note that the increase in the

compounds are much higher than that of diacetyl  temperature and ph dependent", "the oxidative step in the process requires the presence of an oxidizer", "dissolved oxygen may serve as that oxidizer; however, the presence of metal cations in the solution may also act as sources of the oxidizer", "in particular, cu2+ and fe3+ have been suggested as possible oxidizers", " as fermentable sugars in the wort decline in concentration, yeasts begin to uptake extracellular materials to use as energy sources", "vdks are one such source", "if the yeast are still in suspension and have not flocculated too quickly, they will uptake these compounds quickly", "if the yeast have already flocculated, had poor health due to stressed growth, or have already entered a cold conditioning stage, the rate of diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione uptake is slow", " diacetyl can reenter the yeast cell where it is reduced to acetoin and then to 2,3-butanediol (fig", "10.4)", "both acetoin and 2,3-butanediol can be excreted from the cell, but have limited flavor impact", "this is extremely important because dia- cetyl imparts a perceptible butter flavor to the finished beer even at levels as low as 0.02 ppm", "it is true that not every person can perceive the flavor of diacetyl even at elevated concentrations; however, some people are very sensitive to this compound", "and, while it seems like a buttery flavor in your beer might be a good thing, after a few sips its easy to tell that it really does not belong in every style", " alternatively, the brewer can add enzymes directly to the wort", "in particular, - acetolactate decarboxylase can be added to the fermenter", "this enzyme converts \u03b1-acetolactate directly to acetoin", "it bypasses the yeast machinery and removes the diacetyl flavor from the beer", "this is sometimes quite useful because of the par- ticular conditions or strain of yeast used (e.g., an overly flocculant yeast strain would only slowly remove diacetyl)", "

other adjustments  while removal of diacetyl and other vdks is one of the most important goals of conditioning the beer, many other things can be done to stabilize the beer and adjust the beer to match the style parameters", "let us look at each of the different things that can be done and see how to accomplish these tasks", " haze reduction polyphenols (tannins) that are present in the beer after the initial stages of fermentation can combine with proteins (typically in the 10,000-60,000 molecular weight range)", "these larger complexes are held together with hydrogen bonds where the polar groups on both the polyphenols and the proteins interact (fig", "10.5)", "other hazes are also possible", "these include the large \u03b2-glucan mole- cules and calcium oxalate crystals", "calcium oxalate crystals tend not to be an issue as they only form when there are significantly high levels of calcium in the beer after the fermentation is complete", " reducing the haze can be done in the conditioning tanks through the addition of compounds that can remove the polyphenols and/or the proteins in the beer", "an enzyme can be added to the beer that can break the proteins apart", "these proteases include papain-a protease isolated from papaya", "papain is particularly good at cleaving protein bonds and breaking down these larger molecules into smaller ones", "alternatively, the proteins can be removed by the addition of silica gel to the beer", "the highly polar silica gel associates very strongly with the proteins in the beer", "the resulting mass precipitates and falls to the bottom of the vessel where it can be removed from the clarified beer (also known as bright beer)", "advantages to the use of silica include the significant reduction in proteins and \u03b2-glucans", "unfortunately, the disadvantages can outweigh the advantages", "removal of too much of the proteins reduces the amount and stability of the head on the finished beer", "in addition, many of the flavor compounds have polar groups in them and if too much silica gel was used, the result could be a reduction in the flavor of the finished beer", " fig", "10.5 haze production from polyphenols and proteins", "the polyphenols interact by sharing hydrogen atoms with multiple proteins", "the result is a large protein that becomes insoluble in the beer", "as more interactions occur, the haze becomes more and more stable   10.1 why condition?  319  pvpp (polyvinyl polypyrrolidone) is another additive that is somewhat similar in structure to a protein", "thus, it binds to the polyphenols (tannins) in the beer and removes them by forming a precipitate", "of the fining agents, pvpp removes the astringent polyphenols while leaving much of the proteins behind to maintain a stable head on the finished product", " other types of finings work to form a gel that entraps yeast, protein-polyphenol coagulates, and other larger compounds that would normally precipitate", "these finings, however, rapidly speed up the process", "typically, they can clarify the beer completely within 4-5 days", "unflavored gelatin and isinglass are the two most commonly used", "gelatin is exactly what we know it as", "when made up and solidified with fruit flavors, it jiggles and makes a great dessert for young and old alike", "isinglass is a form of collagen prepared from the swim bladders of fish (originally from sturgeon and now from cod)", "the bladders are removed from the fish and then treated and dried", "isinglass or gelatin can be dissolved in water and then added to the conditioning tank", "when they set up, they precipitate and then coagulate the large proteins", "the downside to use of these finings is that they remove essentially everything equally", "it is best to not use these finings unless the yeast have accomplished everything for which they are needed, because once the gelatin or isinglass is added, the yeast will be nearly completely removed", " carbonation while in the conditioning tank, carbon dioxide (co2) can be added to adjust the amount of carbonation in the beer", "typically, co2 is added until the beer contains 1.5-2.8 volumes of co2", "this is accomplished by bubbling co2 through the beer while the tank is sealed", "a tank of purified co2 is attached to the conditioning tank and the tank slowly pressurized", "the best way to add the co2 is through a carbonation stone", " a volume of co2 is the typical measurement of the amount of carbon dioxide dissolved in the beer", "one volume of co2 can be thought of as 1.0 l of co2 dissolved in 1.0 l of beer", "assuming that co2 behaves ideally (an assumption that is relatively acceptable at the pressures and temperatures that we will work with), we can use the ideal gas law to determine how many grams of co2 are in a given volume of co2", "the ideal gas law is:  pv \u00bc nrt  where, p = pressure in atmospheres, v = volume in liters, n = number of moles, r = universal gas constant (0.082 latm/mol k), and, t = temperature in kelvin", " since the number of moles of any substance is equal to its mass in grams (m) divided by its molecular weight in grams/mole (mw), we can substitute this into the ideal gas equation:   320  10 conditioning  pv \u00bc  m mw  rt  pvmw rt \u00bc m  rearranging, gives us a way to calculate the mass if we know the volume of the gas:  assuming that we measure the 1.0 volume of carbon dioxide at 1 atmosphere pressure and room temperature (25 \u00b0c, 298 k), the mass of co2 dissolved in the beer is (note that carbon dioxide has a

from the liquid", "volatile compounds, such as dms, h2s, and o2, can be removed from the beer by bubbling co2 through the beer", "this is best accomplished by leaving the vessel opens to the atmosphere to allow these volatile compounds to escape", " if the beer was carbonated in the primary or secondary fermenter, the pressure of co2 could be too great for the particular style", "so the brewer could also adjust the volumes of co2 by decreasing the pressure on the tank", "care must be taken in this case to make sure that the pressure is slowly reduced in order to reduce the amount of foam that is generated during the process", " flavorings the taste of the beer in the conditioning tank is one of the last places where the beer can be adjusted to give the flavor that is required by the brewer", "for example, if the beer is lacking a particular concentration of ester (such as isoamyl acetate), that compound can be added", "adjustment of the beer flavor can also occur through the addition of fruit, spice, or other flavors", "for example, a brewer may wish to add cherry flavoring to the beer", "adding artificial or natural cherry flavors while the beer is in the conditioning tank could do this", "coloring agents if the srm of the beer is incorrect for the brewer\u2019s requirements, it can be adjusted in the conditioning tank", "typically, this is done by adding caramel color", "dosing this into the beer provides the appropriate color of the beer without adding additional flavor", " hop additions while hop additions typically take place in the secondary in what is called dry hopping, hop oils and reduced hop oils can be added in the condi- tioning tank", "the addition of hop oils can adjust the flavor components to provide a hoppier flavor to the beer", "  10.1

bitterness while at the same time increasing head retention and/or providing light stability", " sugars the sweetness of the beer can also be adjusted at this point", "this can be done through the addition of non-fermentable sugars such as lactose, or through the use of fermentable sugars", "though, if fermentable sugars are used, it is imperative that the yeast be removed from the beer or it will ferment again", "this can be useful if the beer is to be \u201cnaturally\u201d carbonated", "but, it would be particularly disadvan- tageous if the beer were to be packaged with significant quantities of added maltose and still containing yeast", " this problem can be overcome if the beer is to be pasteurized or sterile filtered", "because these methods significantly reduce or eliminate yeast from the finished beer, additional sweetness can be added", "alternative methods to remove the yeast from the beer include adding bacteriostatic compounds to the beer", "typically, this involves the use of so2", "doing so, however, requires that the concentration of this compound be clearly noted on the label because some people are unable to consume this compound without significant health problems", "in most countries, the limit of so2 is 10 ppm", " yeast yes, yeast can be added in the conditioning stage", "this would typically be done to add a strain of yeast that is very good at cleaning up or adjusting some other parameter in the beer", "for example, it may be added to clean up any remaining vdks or to provide a yeast that can naturally carbonate the beer with the remaining

note about the vessel is that it typically has a much flatter bottom than the fermentation vessel", "it is still concave to allow the beer to be removed entirely from the vessel, but because there is

the vessel after fermentation were complete-which could result in the loss of a significant amount of beer during the exchange", "if the carbonation stone were in place prior to the start of fermentation, it would be possible that flocculating yeast and residual trub could clog the pores of the stone and render it less effective in carbonation", "for this reason, should a ccv be employed

microscopic bubble", "the bubble then clings to the site as it grows", "if the gas is co2, the interaction is relatively strong and the bubble has to grow large enough in order to release from the nucleation site and drift up through the beer", "if the bubble is n2, the interaction of the bubble of gas with the nucleation site is fairly weak", "this means that the bubble releases when it is much smaller than if it were co2", " in addition,  to interact with the smaller bubbles of nitrogen gas tend not neighboring bubbles as much as carbon dioxide", "thus, the bubbles tend not to grow into larger bubbles", "when only co2 is the gas in the beer, adjacent bubbles can interact with each other", "the chance exists that these bubbles will merge into larger ones", "and, the amount of surface area of the tiny bubbles means that a tremendous amount of beer is entrapped and suspended in the foam", "the foam is very thick", "in actuality, when two bubbles do merge they do so by a process known as disproportionation", "in this process, one of the bubbles gets larger while the other gets smaller", "the reason for this mechanism of merger can be explored as shown in fig", "11.2",

balloon are more taut and much harder to stretch", " the analogy of the balloons is directly related to what happens to the bubbles in the beer", "the laplace pressure drives the process", "the laplace pressure is the difference in pressure outside of the bubble and the inside of the bubble", "it is very dependent upon the surface tension of the bubble", "it turns out that the laplace pressure is inversely related to the radius of the bubble", "in other words, larger bubbles have a smaller laplace pressure and tend to grow in size when they merge with other bubbles", " one property of nitrogenated (i.e., 25 % n2 and 75 % co2) beers is that the perceived bitterness of the beer is greatly reduced", "research still needs to be completed to understand the mechanism of this effect", "one theory involves the degassing that occurs when the bubbles rapidly form", "this greatly reduces the carbonation level of the beer, its tartness, and its acidity", "the reduction in these three factors will have an impact on the perceived bitterness of the beer", "evidence for this can be found by comparing the flavor of a normally carbonated ipa that has been degassed by stirring for 10 min

completely impervious to light, \u2022 more impervious to oxygen than a bottle, \u2022 lighter and easier to transport, and \u2022 less expensive", " cans are manufactured from a sheet of aluminum in a roll", "as the roll is fed into the machinery, it is sprayed with oils to aid in lubricating the machines and pro- tecting the aluminum from uneven stretching and cracking", "the first machine the sheet aluminum enters is the cupping press", "here, a press stamps out circles about 14 cm in diameter and then bends the aluminum into the shape of a cup", "these cups are thicker than the finished package and much shorter", "however, additional into the shape of the finished aluminum can machines will stretch them out (fig", "11.6)", " the cups (fig", "11.6a) are then fed into the body machine", "the cup is fitted onto a plunger that presses the cup through a ring", "the cup stretches as it passes through the ring, elongating and thinning the cup", "this occurs a number of additional times, each time the ring is slightly smaller", "the finished product is a straight can that is open at one end ((fig", "11.6b-d)", "the bottom of the can takes the shape of the plunger and looks just like the bottom of the finished can", "the final thickness of the can ends up at about 115-120 \u03bcm", " early aluminum cans were much thicker than the modern ones", "trial and error led to the development of \u201clightweighting\u201d the cans by making them thinner", "today computer-aided design has allowed manufacturers to shrink the thickness of the can to the point where the can is significantly lighter (about 13 gm compared to the original 80 gm)", "this saves money on transportation and cost for the can", " the elongated can is then trimmed to the correct length (fig",

the surface of the can", "typical paint application can occur at the rate of over 1000 cans per minute", "after all of the different colors have been applied, a coat of varnish is applied to the exterior of the can", "this coat is placed over the paint to protect it", "heating the can in an oven dries the paint and varnish and hardens the exterior markings on the can", " alternatives to painting a can are possible", "while stickers or other glue-affixed labels are possible, they are typically not applied to the can", "the cans are too flexible to ensure that the label does not peel off or fall off at some point later on", "instead, sleeves of plastic that have been printed with the label can be placed onto the can and then heated", "the shrink-wrap goes on easily and can even be applied after the can is filled (which is the preferred time)", " next, a water-based varnish is sprayed on the inside of the can", "this varnish is put in place to act as a barrier between the aluminum and the contents of the can", "because beer is somewhat acidic, it will react with aluminum slowly", "if left in contact with the aluminum, the beer would eat its way through the can, causing it to rupture from the pressure", " in the final two steps, the can enters the necker-a machine that slowly rolls the can and forms the contraction at the top of the can known as the neck (fig",

order to replace the atmosphere inside the bottle with co2, pulling a vacuum on a can would instantly crush it", "if the brewer wishes to replace the atmosphere inside the can prior to filling it, they can add a nitrogen doser to the packaging line just before the cans are filler", " once full of beer, the cans move along the conveyor belt and a cap is placed on top as a jet of co2 disturbs the top of the beer", "this causes the beer to foam slightly so that the end cap of the can floats on the foam, indicating that no oxygen is present inside the can once it is seamed", "then, the cap and can are joined in the seamer", "the seamer spins the can while a device called a chuck rolls the end of the cap under the flange of the can", "a second chuck then presses the seam together making a tight seal (fig", "11.7)", " disadvantages to canning instead of bottling exist", "beer in a can is a little less carbonated than beer in a bottle due to the way that the bottles are filled", "in other words, the bottles can be counter-pressure filled so that the pressure of the finished   11.3 packaging  fig", "11.7 can seal  345  beer is not different from the conditioning tank", "because cans are not filled this way (i.e., beer is simply poured into the can), the carbonation decreases slightly after sealing until the pressure in the can rises to meet the pressure of the carbon dioxide that is dissolved in the beer", "this can be adjusted by slightly over carbonating the beer at the filler or conditioning tank prior to canning", "the other issue with cans is related to the way they are filled", "it is very difficult to eliminate all of the oxygen from the can during the filling and sealing process", "thus, higher levels of oxygen can be entrapped inside the can as it is sealed", "the levels are still quite low and often have only a minimal impact on the beer", "however, some brewers strongly abhor the idea of oxygen, at any level, in their finished product", " 11.3.1.3 plastic  plastic beer bottles are starting to have some impact on the industry", "plastic does have some advantages over the other small pack, but it also has some disadvantages as well", "the main advantages are:  \u2022 lightweight-about 25 g per bottle, but still heavier than aluminum, \u2022 recyclable-but so are glass and aluminum, \u2022 inexpensive-actually more expensive when you consider the requirement to  use multilayer bottles (see below),  \u2022 noise reduction-significant noise reduction compared to aluminum and glass  during the fill process,  \u2022 insulated-the plastic does offer a little insulation for temperature", " the disadvantages probably outweigh the advantages", "especially if we consider  the arguments for each of the advantages:   346  11 packaging  \u2022 slower filling speed-reduction in production levels, \u2022 permeable-gases can permeate through plastic, \u2022 not thermally stable-requires modifications to pasteurization process because  the plastic may deform under heat", " while some manufacturers and brewers are moving to the plastic bottle because of its versatility in design, the plastic bottle has yet to hit the market

pack  large pack refers to the multi-serve vessels that are used to distribute beer outside of the brewery", "go to any bar or tavern in the usa and you will find a series of beers on tap", "in other words, the bar has a number of kegs of beer from which to serve a beer", "for the consumer, the best price for a pint of ale is had out of the keg", "for the brewer, the lowest profit margin is on the keg", "but only so many people can visit the taproom at the brewery, so this is the way to distribute the product to the masses", " kegs originally were manufactured from aluminum", "however, due to the mal- leability and ductility of aluminum, those kegs tend to be difficult to find anymore", "it did not help the situation that the aluminum keg was easily taken to the recycling center-a fate of many kegs that were stolen", "modern kegs are made from 304 stainless steel", "the keg itself is made in two parts by cutting circles of stainless steel and then forming a top half and bottom half using a technique similar to making an aluminum can", "the final thickness of the stainless steel ends up at about 1.5 mm", "the two halves are then tig (tungsten inert gas) welded around the middle of the keg to make the final container", "the neck and chimes are then welded onto the container to give the overall shape of the keg (fig", "11.8)", " like aluminum kegs, stainless steel kegs can expand", "over time, the keg does grow slightly in size due to heating while under pressure or freezing of the product inside", "heating a keg can be very disastrous", "as the keg gets warm the contents   11.3 packaging  fig", "11.8 cutaway view of a keg  347  inside also heat up", "the beer expands in volume as it gets warmer, and if there is not enough headspace in the keg to handle the increased volume of warm beer, the keg can actually rupture (at least 0.8 l of headspace is required to prevent this if the keg is heated to 70 \u00b0c)", "the main issue is that kegs get warm accidentally", "if a keg gets left in a car out in the sun, the keg is placed directly in the sun, or the keg might even be left under a plastic tarp prior to an event, the temperature of the keg can increase", "if the keg is placed in the freezer, one also needs to be careful", "the cold temperatures might be cold enough to cause the beer to freeze inside the keg", "water, the major constituent in beer, expands as it approaches the freezing point", "thus, the frozen beer occupies much more space than cold beer", "the keg could rupture or at the very least deform from the pressure", " kegs tend to be pressure tested before they are finished in the manufacturing process", "the standard pressure test is to ensure that the keg will not rupture below 90 psi", "since the standard operating pressures of the keg rarely get as high as 30 psi, this provides a large safety range for the keg", " in addition to the body of the keg, a spear is added", "the spear attaches to the neck of the keg and provides a way to admit carbon dioxide and withdraw beer from the bottom of the keg", "because kegs are used worldwide, and because each region uses a variety of keg sizes and styles, the spear is also just as variable", "however, every spear has four basic parts: body, stem, seal, and spring", "the body is the point of attachment of the spear to the keg", "due to thefts, the attachments often involve locking rings or threaded ends that require special tools to dismantle", "the body is also where a coupler is attached to connect the keg to a tap, filler, or cleaner", "the stem is a long tube that reaches almost to the bottom of the keg", "often, the keg has an indentation at the bottom called a sump where the stem reaches", "this is placed so that the majority of the product in the keg can be removed via the stem", "a seal seats against the body that keeps the keg closed until the coupler is attached", "and a spring holds the seal in place", "when the coupler is attached, it pushes down on the spring and moves the seal out of the way", "this allows gas to enter the keg outside of the spear, and liquid to be forced up the spear and through the coupler to the tap", " as we noted, there are many different spear arrangements based on where you are in the world", "here in the usa, the most common spear is known as a   348  11 packaging  \u201cd-system\u201d valve", "this spear has an indentation in the body where the coupler seats and locks into place before the spring are pushed down", "other common arrange- ments include the \u201ca-system\u201d valves that are flat", "these require that the coupler attaches to the outside of the spear body", " kegs in the brewery take longer to fill than small pack, but follow a very similar process", "first the kegs are placed onto a conveyor belt by either a robot or man- ually", "the kegs are then inverted and passed into an external washer", "the external washer sprays caustic and rinse water successively on the kegs and ensures that the the kegs move on to the outside of the keg is as clean as possible", "then, cleaner/filler", "in some cases, a special machine is located before the cleaner/filler that checks to make sure that the spear is properly attached to the keg", " in the cleaner filler, the inverted keg is coupled to the machine and the spear engaged", "in cycles, a blast of water is injected into the keg to rinse out any remaining beer or other material from the interior of the keg", "this is then pushed out using air", "spraying caustic or another cleaner through the stem washes the keg", "because the keg is upside down, the caustic rushes to the end of the stem and sprays against the bottom of the keg", "the caustic then collects at the top of the keg and exits through the gas port", "the keg is then rinsed with water, and then sanitized by either spraying sanitizer through the keg or by rinsing the keg with water that is at least 80-85 \u00b0c", "this hot water rinse can ensure that all microbes are killed inside the keg", " finally, the keg is turned back over and carbon dioxide is blown through the stem", "the co2 exits through the top of the spear until all of the air and oxygen have been removed", "restricting the flow of the gas exiting the keg increases the pressure of the co2", "when the pressure is approximately the same as the pressure of the beer in the conditioning tank, beer is allowed to flow into the keg down the stem", "in this way, the beer fills the keg from the bottom up, pushing out the excess gases in the way", "a scale or flow meter is used to ensure that the exact amount of beer is added into the keg", " the keg is then detached from the machine and conveyed to the next station that cleans the body of the spear and applies a label around the neck of the keg", "the station also attaches a cap to the neck to signal that the keg is full", "they are then placed into the refrigerator and await their transportation to the bar or tavern", " some keg fillers operate completely in the inverted position", "the keg is washed inverted as before, but left inverted as it is filled through the gas port", "this means that the beer still fills from the bottom up as the gas exits through the stem of the spear", "the keg is still filled until the volume of beer in the keg matches the correct fill level", "again, this can be measured by many different methods", "  11.4 pasteurization  11.4 pasteurization  349  what is pasteurization? this is a process that was first discovered by french che- mist louis pasteur in 1864 while he was exploring why wine tended to sour with age", "by this time, he had already determined that yeast were the reason why the sugars were converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide, and that oxygen was not needed for yeast to survive", "it was in the 1870s that he began working on fer- mentation problems in the brewing industry", "his hope was to provide information that would help the french brewing industry surpass the german industry (who at the time had a very well developed brewing industry and produced some of the best beers in the world.)  what pasteur found was that most of the yeast used to make beer in france was actually not pure yeast, but instead a mixture of bacteria, mold, yeast, and other fungi", "he strongly advocated for heating the beer after it was made to eliminate these organisms and allow the beer flavor to be stable", "he also suggested that tartaric acid be used to purify the yeast prior to its use", "unfortunately, this did not work very well", " it was emil hansen, a danish chemist, who carried pasteur\u2019s work further", "hansen worked at the carlsberg laboratory (a research company spun off from the carlsberg brewery in by its founder jacob c", "jacobsen) on the problem of impure yeast", "he determined that it was possible to separate a specific colony of yeast into a pure strain that would cleanly ferment wort into beer", "this first strain of yeast he named saccharomyces carlsbergensis after the laboratory where he worked", "it was not until the mid 1980s that it was determined that this is the same species of yeast as saccharomyces pastorianus, the lager yeast named after louis pasteur that was identified almost 15 years earlier than hansen\u2019s work", " it was clear even then that pasteur\u2019s contributions to the brewing industry were incredibly valuable", "by far one of pasteur\u2019s most important discoveries was pas- teurization", "this is the process that eliminates almost all microbes", "it has been applied to milk, wine, juices, and beer", "the goal of this process is to accomplish the task of eliminating microbes without changing the flavor of the product", " there are many different levels of elimination of microbes that must be con- sidered", "this is the same argument as between the words clean, disinfect, sanitize, and sterile", "it typically results in the definition of the degree of elimination of microbes", "for example, if something is made sanitary, it results in a 99.999 % of all microbes", "this is typically the level of cleanliness needed in the brewery", "to make something sterile, it needs to result in 99.99999999 % reduction in the microbes", "this can be difficult to obtain", " how is the degree of pasteurization measured in the industry? the amount of \u201cpasteurization\u201d depends on the temperature and length of time", "a pasteurization unit (pu) is one way to measure how much \u201cpower\u201d is applied to the elimination of microbes in beer", "specifically, 1 pu is defined as the amount of \u201cpower\u201d applied in a product heated to 60 \u00b0c for one minute", "first defined by del vecchio in 1951, the pu is calculated from

this equation works to calculate the number of pu that is applied to a beer when it is heated at any temperature", "note from the equation that this implies a tenfold increase in effect for every 7 \u00b0c increase in temperature", "in addition, temperatures less than 60 \u00b0c generate very small pu values", "in other words, holding a beer at a temperature less than 60 \u00b0c will require a significant amount of time to obtain any measure of pu value", " let us assume the brewer wishes to achieve 30 pu", "to obtain this many pas- teurization units, the beer would need to spend 30 min at 60 \u00b0c", "however, because of the equation, the degree of pasteurization is not linear with temperature", "so, elevated temperatures are more effective at killing microorganisms", "and, at those higher temperatures, the time to achieve the same pu will be reduced", "as an example, let us rearrange eq", "11.4 to solve for the time to achieve 30 pu at various elevated temperatures:  30 pu

a d = 0.091", "thus, pediococcus is more thermally stable than other microbes", " the amount of pu needed to effectively eliminate microbes in beer will depend on the type of microorganisms we are trying to kill (as indicated as well by the decimal reduction time", "for example, wild yeasts in are more resistant to heat than the standard brewer\u2019s yeasts (s", "cerevisiae, s", "pastorianus)", "therefore, the beer contaminated by wild yeasts will require more pu to make the product stable", "table 11.5 lists some common spoilage organisms in beer and how many pus are required to have the same killing power as 1 pu on brewer\u2019s yeast", "note that table 11.5 does not list enzymes", "flavor-damaging enzymes can also survive into the finished beer", "to make sure that the beer is truly flavor stable as long as possible, it is imperative that any enzymes are destroyed in pasteurization", "they tend to be quite thermally stable", " how effective is pasteurization? applying 20 pu to a beer during pasteurization indicates that only 1 in 10 billion microbes has a chance of surviving", "at 30 pu, this drops to only 1 in 1015", "the survivor, if one did survive, would be hard to find if you looked through an entire bottle of beer", "luckily, brewer\u2019s yeast produce invertase and the activity of this enzyme can be used to determine the effectiveness of the pasteurization", "typically, this is done by adding invertase to a beer and measuring its activity prior to the pasteurization and after the pasteurization", "then, the reduction in the activity is a measure of how effective the treatment is on the product", " checkpoint 11.3 some brewers only provide 15 pu to their product before shipping", "how long would it take to obtain

pasteurization", "in this approach, the beer is first packaged in bottles or cans and sealed", "then, the sealed packages are sent through a \u201ctunnel\u201d where they are sprayed with recirculating heated water", "the product\u2019s temperature is slowly raised from bottling temperature to the desired pasteurization temperature and held there for the desired rest time", "then, the temperature is lowered back to bottling tem- perature by spraying the packages with cooler water", " an example tunnel pasteurization configuration is shown in fig", "11.9", "in this simple design, there are five regions where the product is either heated or cooled, and one region where the temperature remains constant", "as the bottles or cans enter region 1 on a conveyor, they are slowly heated by water that was used to cool the packages leaving region 5", "by coupling the entrance and exit water recirculation in this manner, the amount of energy required from outside of the system is mini- mized", "heat energy is added or removed as necessary through heat exchangers in order to keep the temperature of region 1 and 5 constant", "regions 2 and 4 are likewise coupled; again raising the temperature of the packages as they travel through region 2 and cooling through region 4", "region 3 in fig", "11.9 is the main pasteurization region", "it is here where the packaged beer is at our final, elevated pasteurization temperature and will spend most of its time through the tunnel", " tunnel pasteurization does not work well with larger packages, such as kegs", "with the increased volume of beer in the sealed container and the materials of the package itself, it would take an unreasonable amount of time and energy to ensure that the packaged beer is thoroughly heated", "if pasteurization is needed for large pack, another method needs to be utilized by the brewer to effectively remove bacterial contamination from the finished beer", " the final pasteurization fig", "11.9

temperature for the desired amount of time, and then cooled before being placed in a package", "this approach can be applied to virtually any packaging vessel; bottles, cans, or kegs", "the approach requires the packaging vessel to be aseptically clean prior to filling", "in addition, it also requires that the piping, tubing, and packaging apparatus itself be sterile", "it would do no good at all to have a contaminated feed line from the pasteurizer to the bottle", " a generalized flash pasteurization method is shown in fig", "11.10", "the apparatus essentially consists of a plate chiller that is converted to allow one region to heat the beer, a second region to hold the hot beer, and a third region to cool the beer back to bottling temperature", "the first step involves pumping the finished beer into a heat exchanger that warms the beer to the pasteurization temperature", "the warm beer travels through a heated array of pipe ensuring that the beer spends an appropriate amount of time at pasteurization temperatures", "then the beer is cooled right before being sealed in an aseptically clean vessel", " since the degree of pasteurization depends on the time the beer is held at an  elevated temperature, we modify eq", "11.4  pu \u00bc  v q() ()  () 1:389\u00f0t()60 ()c\u00fe  \u00f011:6\u00fe  where v is the volume of holding tube at the elevated temperature (in m3), and q

temperature for 5.5 min, or 348 s to achieve 30 pu", "what we would like to calculate is the length of piping needed so that the beer stays at this temperature for the required time", "first, let us assume that our bottle filler is capable of filling 6 standard 12 oz bottles every second", "this implies we need a volumetric flow rate of  q \u00bc 6 ()  12 oz s  ()  29:6 cm3 1 oz  \u00bc  2131 cm3

temperature to 70 \u00b0c, the time that the beer needs to spend in the pipe drops to 67.3 s, so the length is now about 18.26 m", "again, there is a trade-off; the higher temperature will reduce our equipment needs, but one runs the risk of changing the flavor of the beer", "if we wanted only 10 pu applied to the beer for pasteurization, the length of tubing (at the same volumetric flow rate) gets even shorter", " one significant issue is important to consider with the use of a flash pasteurizer", "because the beer will be heated well above the finished beer temperature, we must consider that effect on the carbonation of the product", "the same effect is seen in the tunnel pasteurizer, but because the bottles or cans are sealed, no carbonation is lost", "the flash pasteurizer, on the other hand, can cause the beer to degas as it moves into the holding region", "this can be a serious issue (loss of carbonation)", "so the brewer   11.4 pasteurization  355  must pay particular attention to the pressure of the system and increase it signifi- cantly as it goes through the flash pasteurizer to ensure that the beer does not degas", "the heat exchangers themselves are very similar to the plate chillers that we explored in an earlier chapter", "these devices use hot water to warm the beer to the appropriate temperature", "they can be counter flow or concurrent flow and the volumetric flow rate becomes the determining factor in how much heat is applied to the beer", "the typical design is as a counter-flow exchanger", "often, the water (or water-glycol mixture) is recycled from the chiller portion of the heat exchanger into the heater portion", "additional heat can be applied to ensure that the heater reaches the desired temperature", "and then the water or water-glycol mixture is cooled down to allow the chiller to reach the appropriate temperature", "this recycling saves tremendous amounts of energy for the brewery", " 11.4.3 other methods of pasteurization  other types of devices exist to effectively result in pasteurizing beer", "one such device involves the use of a filter", " a plate and frame filter is a device where a filter,

what is quality?  we briefly touched on the definition of this word in chap", "4", "let us look at the subject again, but in a more detailed way", "as we saw in chap", "4, quality is a loaded word", "it means different things to different people", "a high-quality beer has one meaning to the customer and a different meaning to the brewer", "to the customer, the measure of quality is likely linked to their level of satisfaction with the beer", "this satisfaction comes from their perception of the taste, how they feel the beer looks in the glass, and, believe it or not, how much money they pay for the beer", "in fact, there are many factors that lead into the customer\u2019s decision about the quality of a particular beer", "and, a beer that one person believes is high quality may be considered quite the opposite by another person", "the expert taster and beer judge may consider a beer to be high quality if it conforms adequately to a particular beer style", "if it is out of style the beer judge may consider the beer as low quality", "even if everyone believed a beer was high quality, the brewer may disagree", " that disagreement arises because quality has a different meaning to the brewer", "to the brewer, the cellarman, the packaging specialist, and everyone else working in the brewery, quality may imply adherence to a particular style or even agreement with the design specifications", "a brew that falls outside of those specifications or style guidelines may be rejected by the brewer and discarded", "it may be perfectly fine to drink, but the brewer may consider it to be low quality", "it may be tasteful enough to sell in the taproom, but because it is classed as a low-quality product, the brewer does not do so", " the discrepancy between quality to the consumer and quality to the brewer gives rise to a quandary", "who is right? is everyone correct? the answer is based in the meaning of the word", "every individual determines the quality of a beer using his or her own metrics", "so a high-quality beer to the brewer may not be high quality to others", "just because the beer judge classifies a homebrewed ale as high quality, drinkers may completely disagree", " \u00a9 springer international publishing switzerland 2017 m", "mosher and k", "trantham, brewing science: a multidisciplinary approach, doi 10.1007/978-3-319-46394-0_12  359   360  12 quality assurance and quality control  but then, how do we determine whether a beer is high quality or low quality? it is obvious that the perception of quality lies with the individual, so determining the quality of the beer would be nearly impossible (unless, of course, everyone agrees)", "instead of worrying about the quality of the beer, the brewer focuses on creating a product that will sell to the customer", "if there is a demand for the beer, the brewer has made a good product", "if the demand is lackluster or nonexistent, the brewer does not repeat that beer", " not all breweries look at quality this way", "some are fixated on the production of beers that match their specifications for a particular style", "others focus on the design parameters and require their beers meet them every batch", "still others ignore all of this and just make beer, likely figuring that if they make it, people will drink it", "most of these breweries struggle to stay in business or close their doors permanently", " so while high quality is something that every brewer tries to make, customers are the ones that make the decision", "focusing on making high-quality beers, then, requires that the brewer includes the customer in the equation", "brewers still need to ensure that the current batch of beer is the same as the previous batches", "the focus is on consistency", "consistently making a beer requires systematic approaches to the control of the parameters of the beer", "everyone in the brewery must be following that plan", "measurements must be taken and decisions on the next steps made in order to maintain that consistency", "however, in the end, it all boils down to the decision of the customer", "in other words, a brewery could manufacture a beer very consistently such that every parameter of the beer was within the specifications, but it could still not sell because the customer has decided that the beer is not high quality", " 12.2 quality control  to ensure that a particular beer is the same as others, the brewery often institutes a plan that measures key features of the beer as it goes through the brewing process", "simply measuring a parameter and then writing it down will not work", "even if the best analytical techniques are used and the value of the parameter is accurate and precise to the greatest number of significant figures, the process is not complete", "the plan must include a way to use the measured values of the beer\u2019s parameters to adjust, evaluate, and inform the brewer about the state of affairs on a particular batch", "there is no point in measuring a particular parameter if the end result is to have a record of it", " in addition, as we will see in the next section, measuring those parameters must have a relational feedback into a process", "a plan to maintain the consistency, any quality control process, works well only if it is part of the bigger picture", "for example, let us assume a brewer measures and keeps track of the mash temperature in every batch", "adjustments can be made to the temperature of a particular mash in order to maintain the consistency in the batch versus other batches", "however, unless   12.2 quality control  361  feedback into the brewery exists where those values are evaluated by the entire brewery, the variability in mash temperature may become commonplace", "that would imply that the brewer would need to measure and adjust the mash temper- ature for every batch", "constant adjustment of the batches does not always put the particular batch back on track to be consistent with earlier batches", "for example, let us say the brewer notes that the current mash-in resulted in a temperature of 60 \u00b0c (140 \u00b0f) when it was supposed to be 67 \u00b0c (153 \u00b0f)", "the time it takes to raise the mash temperature to the specified 67 \u00b0c means that the current batch has rested at \u03b2-amylase\u2019s optimum temperature", "even a short this temperature has adjusted the ratio of fermentable to unfermentable sugars in the resulting wort", "this could cause significant variations that would need adjustment at every stage after the mash", "however, with feedback to the entire brewery, it might be found that an earlier step is not being monitored and is the reason for the variability", " time at  quality control is necessary", "it is the working end of the process, where different control parameters are monitored and measured", "it is the physical measurement of properties of the product as it goes through the brewing process", "but without integration of those measurements into a larger plan, quality control becomes more of a knee-jerk reaction to what is going on", "while breweries that perform only quality control can react and make adjustments to values that fall outside of the specifications for a particular brew, the overall consistency that all brewers try to attain will fail to be adequately achieved", " 12.2.1 safety in the brewery  quality control requires an adequate safety program for the brewery", "monitoring and measuring different parameters must include monitoring of the safety processes as well", "safety means not only the safety of the workers and the processes, but also the safety of the final product that the brewery produces", " 12.2.1.1 worker safety it is essential that every worker in the brewery is trained", "the process of making beer involves, at a minimum, working with hot liquids (*100 \u00b0c, *212 \u00b0f), electricity, natural gas, and caustic and acidic cleaning agents", "while the brewing process can be fairly predictable, accidents do happen", "the most common of these accidents typically results in someone getting burned from contact with a hot liquid or surface", "signage that reminds or warns people about a particularly hazardous area or process should also be plainly posted", " any apprenticing or training in the brewery should include extensive safety training", "most people would recommend regular safety meetings and periodic safety retraining", "such practice can significantly reduce the chance of an accident", "yes, these programs require an investment of time and money, but the payback far exceeds the investment", "for example, if a worker is accidentally electrocuted because the safety protocols were not known or practiced in the brewery, the cost to   362  12 quality assurance and quality control  the brewery alone (not counting the harm done to the worker) in legal fees, judg- ments against the brewery if they lose a legal case, and medical expenses can be a catastrophic expense", "in some cases, without proper insurance, the brewery may have to be sold to pay for the damages", "with that in mind, the cost to run a safety program is a very wise investment", " any safety training must provide the workers with standard operating procedures (sops) that describe in very specific steps what should be done at each stage of the brewing process", "for example, when using a portable pump, the worker must understand and follow each step in the sop in order to safely use the pump", "these sops must be written down, posted, and distributed to each worker", "it also is a good practice to remind and practice those working in the brewery about the sops to ensure that everyone is familiar with them", "the lack of sops in a brewery setting is not an excusable omission from a successful operation", " in addition, every person allowed on the brewery floor must be trained in the sop for every step in the brewing process", "for larger breweries, this training may be limited to the points of access for the workers", "this mass training is required because it may be necessary for someone to step in and do a job that they don not typically perform", "and if they are not trained or know the sop by heart, they probably should not be stepping into help in that area", "let us go back to our example of the portable pump", "if one worker sets up and begins the transfer of hot wort to the boil kettle using a portable pump, but then leaves the area to accomplish another task elsewhere in the brewery, any worker that steps into turn off and tear down the pump must be familiar with the sop", "it could be disastrous if an untrained worker incorrectly detached the hose to the pump without closing out the valves on either end", " any safety training must also include the use of personal protective equipment (ppe)", "this category of equipment includes goggles, face shields, gloves, steel-toed boots, aprons, long pants, and other items designed to protect the wearer from hazards in the brewery", "for example, under no circumstances should a worker be allowed to wear sandals while they work in the brewery", "yes, the wearer will argue that the goggles are uncomfortable, that it is too hot to wear jeans or coveralls, or that they will only be doing the task for a couple of minutes", "all of their statements may be true (likely they are just inconvenienced by the use of ppe), but the protective equipment must be worn or used in order to work in the brewery", "there should never be an exception to anyone about the use of ppe", " any safety training must include steps on what to do in case of an emergency", "this includes the standard training on what to do in the event of a fire, but also should include tornado drills and active shooter drills", "moreover, and just as importantly, the training should provide every worker with the tools they need to assist others in the event that an accident occurs", "for example, if a worker slips and falls down the stairs to the boil kettle, the nearby workers are likely the first on the scene", "they should know how to provide at least minimal first aid, know whether its safe to move the patient, and know how to seek assistance in the most efficient manner", "they should be aware of how to crash (rapidly turn off) any process with which they are engaged in order to lend assistance (it is better to lose a batch of beer   12.2 quality control  363  to provide assistance, comfort, and care for an injured worker, than to ignore the worker because its time to add hops to the boil)", "some brewers may disagree with that practice, but they should not", "yes, the loss of a batch may impact the bottom line, but the safety, comfort, and health of the workforce is significantly more valuable", "and every brewer would not want the bad publicity of the injured and disgruntled worker should they be ignored or placed second to the brewing process after an accident", " trainings should address the proper use of safety equipment, such as fire blankets, fire extinguishers, eye wash stations, and safety showers", "each of these pieces of equipment should also be readily available in the brewery such that a worker would be able to obtain them for use immediately", "in other words, storing all of the fire extinguishers in the main office when the fire is on the other end of the building is not good practice", " as we noted, regular trainings to go through each of the safety aspects of working in a brewery are also essential", "everyone tends to forget the little tricks and nuances of steps, and refreshing their memory is the best practice", "the trainings, depending upon many different factors, should be no less than once a month", "this gives time as well to providing feedback on accidents to the entire brewery", "for example, an accident in a brewery can be used as a teaching tool to inform others about potential hazards", "an accident can also inform everyone and potentially reveal a hazardous condition that was previously unseen", " overall, the best practice is to promote a \u201cculture of safety\u201d in the operation of the brewery", "safety should be first in everyone\u2019s mind", "safety should be thought of at all times", "general operations without thinking about safety should not be per- formed", "and if every worker is thinking about safety first, the chance of an accident is greatly reduced", " 12.2.1.2 food safety food safety and hygiene is paramount to any operation that makes and sells products that will be consumed by others", "this is often referred to as whole- someness-although the connotation of wholesomeness is that the product some- how is nutritious", "this may be the case, especially when beer is the product, but that is not the intent of the word", "instead, wholesomeness is a measure of all of the practices that are in place to ensure the product being made is safe and fit for human consumption", " the biggest issue with determining the safety of a product and how fit it is for consumption is being able to verify that it has not been contaminated during pro- duction", "specifically, the product must be free of foreign objects, chemical con- taminants, or pathogenic microbes", " foreign objects it is possible that a foreign object becomes introduced into the product during its manufacture", "this could be a metal shard from a machine, a piece of glass from a bottle, a spider or other insect, or a rock or stone that somehow falls into the product", "there are many locations in the process where it would be possible for a foreign object to get added into the stream", "for example, a piece of glass could   364  12 quality assurance and quality control  get introduced into a bottle if the capper accidentally hits the side of the bottle", "a piece of the finish or a portion of the sealing surface could flake off and land in the beer", "(good practice when drinking beers is to not drink one where the finish, sealing surface, or lip has been damaged", "pouring the beer into a glass first is also a good idea.)  foreign objects can also be introduced in the ingredients that come from other suppliers", "for this reason alone, it is important that the brewer understands their ingredients and where they come from, works with suppliers to build a relationship of trust, and verifies the quality of the ingredients periodically", "for example, it is possible that a metal shard is mixed into the malt used to make the beer", "in this case, its likely that the metal shard will be removed during the sparge step, but it is possible that it could make its way through to a consumer\u2019s glass at the end of the process", " chemical contaminants the job of the brewer involves about 90 % cleaning, 15 % paperwork, and 5 % brewing", "yes, that does add up to over 100 %, but the emphasis is on cleaning", "most brewers spend considerable time cleaning and sanitizing", "the advent of cip means that brewers do not have to babysit the cleaning process, but it is still a process that requires a significant amount of time", "with the number of pipes, hoses, and tanks in the brewery, it is possible that one of these is not rinsed as well as it should be", "the result could be the addition of some cleaner in the finished beer", "mixproof valves, for instance, control the flow of multiple streams of liquids", "with poor maintenance, it is possible that the valve leaks liquid from one stream into another", " many of the possible chemical contaminants in the brewery are fairly toxic", "after all, they are used to scrub residues off of stainless steel and kill microbes easily", "they do have a flavor in large concentrations, but diluted into a large batch of beer, and it might be impossible to taste that they are present", "more importantly, many of the chemical contaminants can react with the flavor components in beer and end up changing the flavor of the product", "therefore, it is prudent to use the least toxic cleaners possible and to periodically test batches with laboratory anal- yses to ensure that no contamination exists", "that and a thorough and regular maintenance program will help ensure none of these compounds ends up in the finished product", " pathogenic microbes the good news is that most pathogenic microbes that are harmful to human health tend not to survive in beer", "the concentrations of alcohol and the presence of hop oil constituents (including the iso-\u03b1-acids) work as ster- ilizing agents for these microbes", "while nonpathogenic microbes such as lacto- bacillus and pediococcus can be found in beer, their only damage is to sour the beer by producing production of acids and create other off-flavors that make the beer not taste good", "consumption of these microbes is not considered a human hazard (lactobacillus is one of the bacteria used to make yogurt and exists as living bacteria in yogurt with \u201cactive cultures\u201d)", "other nonpathogenic bacteria can make their way   12.2 quality control  365  into the finished beer, but each tends to produce an odor or flavor that would immediately signal the end of the consumer\u2019s enjoyment", "for example, contami- nation of beer from megasphera cerevisiae would be signaled with the aroma of rotten eggs and the flavor of vomit", "not many consumers would even swallow the first taste of a beer contaminated with this bacterium", " some of the pathogenic bacteria, such as escherichia coli (e", "coli), also produce rancid odors that would make the beer very unpalatable", "salmonella and e", "coli are potential issues in beer, but only when the alcohol concentration is very low (<1 % abv)", "both cause health hazards if consumed, so care must be taken to avoid their entry into the product", "other potential pathogenic microbes include cryptosporidium and clostridium botulinum", "cryptosporidium, which causes diarrhea, can enter the brewery through the use of untreated or unboiled water in the brewery", "for example, if a hose is cleaned and then rinsed with municipal water, traces of cryptosporidium could remain in the hose", "if the hose is then used to transfer beer, it is likely that the microbe could end up in the finished beer", "the same is true for c", "botulinum, a microbe responsible for the production of botulinum toxin", "this toxin is extremely lethal", "a dose of about 75 ng (1/4 the mass of a single grain of sand) gives the victim about a 50 % chance of survival", "this microbe is very common in soils across the globe and could enter the product stream if, for instance, unwashed and dirty strawberries were added to a beer just before packaging", "luckily, the acidity of the beer is the saving grace that should kill most microbes", " the preservative properties of beer have been a useful protection from the introduction of many of the more harmful microbes", "in the usa, this is why the food and drug administration (fda) tends to allow other federal agencies to monitor the production of beer, wine, and other alcoholic beverages", "however, any low- or non-alcoholic beverage is monitored by the fda", "for example, if a brewery also manufactures root beer to sell to those that are designated drivers, the product must adhere to the fda standards for wholesomeness", "these standards are much more stringent than the monitoring standards for beer production", " best practices in the production of beer, however, will ensure the wholesome- ness of the product", "having a stringent quality control program that ensures con- sistency in production will then evaluate and inform about the presence of things that may be classified as food safety hazards", " 12.2.1.3 methods in quality control quality control methods require not only measuring the parameter of a particular process, but also recording that measurement for use in the quality assurance portion of the management of the brewery", "charting is one of those methods that can be employed and used on the brewery floor for rapid \u201cgo-no-go\u201d determinations of product quality", "charting is the process of adding measurements to a graph and noticing the result of the placement of the measurement", " for example, a chart could be constructed that illustrated the mash-in temper- ature for a particular beer", "figure 12.1 illustrates an example of a chart that could be used", "the chart contains maximum and minimum permissible values of the   366  12 quality assurance and quality control  measurement", "it also contains a line drawn in the middle of the chart that indicates the quality standard for that parameter", "each measurement is placed on the chart as the next entry", " note that this chart indicates that over the last 10 batches, none of the mash-in temperatures have been above the maximum permissible or below the minimum permissible value", "this would immediately indicate that in each batch, there was no need to adjust the temperature of the batch", " note as well that selection of the maximum and minimum permissible values must be well thought out", "the brewer could have indicated the maximum tem- perature as 82 \u00b0c (180 \u00b0f), but this would be unusable in the brewery", "why? because if the mash-in occurs at 81 \u00b0c (179 \u00b0f), still below the maximum, all of the enzymes would be denatured and no mashing would take place", "similarly, if the brewer required the maximum temperature as 67.278 \u00b0c (153.10 \u00b0f) and the minimum permissible temperature as 67.272 \u00b0c (153.09 \u00b0f), it may be extremely difficult or even impossible to accurately measure the temperature of the entire mash to that level of significance", " another charting example that is more useful is the cusum chart", "cusum stands for cumulative sum", "in this chart, the difference between the measurement and the target quality standard is added to the previous difference", "the chart still contains maximum deviations from the quality standard, and these still act as action levels", "but, the difference in this chart is that trends in the data appear", "figure 12.2 shows exactly the same data as does fig", "12.1, but here, we notice a problem indicating action", "in other words, the temperature of the mash-in has been con- sistently running lower than the desired", "this appears easily on the cusum chart indicating an issue somewhere in the overall process", " fig", "12.1 charting example", "here, the example is the plot of mash-in temperatures for a porter, obtained during each batch made in the brewery   12.2 quality control  367  fig", "12.2 cusum chart of mash-in temperatures", "data are taken from fig", "12.1  the trends found in a cusum chart are very useful in determining issues in the overall process", "if an issue exists, it will show up as a trend going either up or down on the chart", "that provides a very good signal to the brewer that something is not right and needs to be adjusted", " checkpoint 12.1 outline the key features of a successful worker safety program", "define an sop and explain why it is useful to have in the brewery", " 12.3 quality assurance  as we discovered in the previous section, the quality control program is simply not enough to produce a quality product consistently", "that is where quality assurance comes into play", "quality assurance is the plan that implements the quality control program and combines it with good manufacturing practices", "where quality control is the inspection of the process, quality assurance is the process where the results of the inspection feed back into the overall operation of the brewery", "quality assurance works to prevent mistakes in production that effect product quality by considering the operation of the entire system", "quality control, on the other hand, detects and adjusts or rejects an individual process product", "  368  12 quality assurance and quality control  quality assurance compares the outcomes of the well-performed quality control program to specified quality standards", "deviations from those standards dictates courses of action that may require re-examination of the particular processes in the brewery, retooling of equipment, replacement of processes with better ones, or re-evaluation of the process as a whole", "remember that quality assurance is a system-wide examination of the process, whereas quality control is involved only in the individual product output", " quality standards are part of the equation in quality assurance", "these are parameters determined from the brewer\u2019s specifications and customer

brewer knows the capabilities of the process and the limitations of what can and cannot be accomplished", "the quality standards must include customer preferences", "only the customer can talk to the level of quality of the beer from a purchasing standpoint", "and input should not be limited to just one customer group", "for example, a beer that is made in one town should not only seek the customer preference from that town", "the brewery should also seek input from nearby towns based on their distribution pattern", "if the brewery plans to increase sales in a different town, they should first seek customer preferences in that town and develop quality standards that speak to those preferences", " approaches to quality assurance reflect the systemic examination of the process",

approach to quality where:  - quality is determined by customers", "- management has responsibility to ensure quality", "- systematic evaluation of all processes is required", "- improvements must be made at all times", " \u2022 statistical analysis and control-evaluation of all quality control data to rec-  ognize and eliminate defects in production before they occur", " \u2022 iso-the international organization for standardization (iso) is a group of over 130 member national standards organizations", "after training and an external audit, a brewery can be registered as iso-9001 compliant", "the basic principles of iso-9001 are focused on the following:  - customer focus; - leadership; - engagement of people; - process approach;   12.3 quality assurance  369  - improvement; - evidence-based decision making; and - relationship management", " other quality assurance methods and practices exist", "but all focus on essentially the same things", "how those practices are applied dictates which of the systems that a particular brewery is using", "the basic principles in each of these systematic methods of quality assurance are customer, improvement, and management focused", " so, does a brewery have to have and follow a quality assurance protocol in order to produce a high-quality product? the answer is no", "but, without a protocol in place, it is very difficult to be consistent in that production of high-quality products", "and in these days of rapid growth in the craft brewery industry in the usa, customers with little disposable cash, and adventurous customers that do not mind trying new things, lack of consistency in beer production may end up resulting in a lack of customers", "while the question has not been fully decided, it would be interesting to poll those customers of failed microbreweries and ask them why they believed the brewery went out of business", " 12.4 haccp analysis  one method of system-wide evaluation is the application of the principles of haccp (hazard analysis and critical control points) to the brewing process", "this approach focuses on food safety, but the overall principles can be applied to the production of any material, product, or service by simply adjusting the definition of hazard", "in general, a hazard is anything that can harm the quality of the finished product", "in food safety, this could be microbial, chemical, or physical in nature", "for example, a microbial hazard would be the introduction of lactobacillus into the wort stream after the boil", "a chemical hazard might be the introduction of caustic cleaning solution into the product", "and a physical hazard might be the presence of glass fragments in the finished beer", " haccp evaluates the entire process stream from the inputs of ingredients coming into the brewery to the end of the stream where the consumer is sipping on the beer", "every point along that path is evaluated for a hazard to the quality of the final product", "and if a hazard is identified, it is further evaluated to determine whether a critical control point exists at that location", "if one does exist, then monitoring the brewing process occurs at that point", "if it does not exist, then there is no need to monitor the brewing process there", " a critical control point is a location, process, or step in the production process where some control could be made to prevent a hazard from entering the process", "evaluation of each point in the process requires asking questions about the potential critical point to decide if it truly exists at the point", "typically, a flow chart can aid in making the decision", "questions such as \u201cdoes a hazard exist at this point?\u201d, \u201ccould   370  12 quality assurance and quality control  a hazard be introduced at this point?\u201d, \u201cwill a future step reduce the hazard?\u201d, and \u201cdoes this step require control for safety?\u201d can be helpful in determining if the point is a critical control point", " in some cases, determining a critical control point may involve determining the relative impact of the step or process on the final product quality versus the chance that the hazard will exist", "in these cases, a risk assessment is performed", "this bases the risk of the hazard happening versus the risk to product safety", "once performed, it may be determined that the risk of both things happening is high, and a critical control point should be considered", "if the risk to both things happening is low, the step or process may not be a critical control point", "the assessment comes about when the risk to one or both is intermediate", "then, a decision must be made whether to apply resources to the monitoring, recording, and reporting for the step or process", " once the critical control points are identified, each of them is further evaluated and delineated into a sop for monitoring and reporting", "specifically, the hazard is identified, the limits of the analysis are determined, corrective actions are identified if the limits are exceeded, and a reporting and verification plans are outlined", "an example of a critical control point is shown in fig", "12.3", "this example illustrates a critical control point for diacetyl in the conditioning tank", " once the haccp plan is in place, it must be followed", "it will generate data from monitoring each of the steps or processes", "the data need to be evaluated periodi- cally to systematically assess the overall process and each of the critical control points", "verification that each of the corrective actions has been successful in mit- igating the hazards is needed", "this may be supported by further, more detailed, analyses at the critical control points to ensure that the process and its corrective actions are appropriately controlling the particular hazards", "finally, the haccp plan itself needs to be assessed to ensure that the plan itself is working", "in addition, if any changes to the process have been made since the plan was created, the periodic review allows those changes to be implemented into the plan", " fig", "12.3 critical control point for diacetyl

considered as verification of the data (it cannot be a critical control point, because there is no corrective action that can be taken once the consumer is tasting the beer)", " one way to provide that consumer feedback is to use sensory analyses", "sensory it says: the beer is evaluated for its taste and analysis means exactly what appearance", "sensory analyses provide quality control information, product devel- opment for experimental batches, and troubleshooting for potential off-flavors", "some sensory analyses can provide basic information on consumer preferences, but they are not designed to give that information", "for detailed information on customer preferences, specific testing geared to the desired outcomes must be undertaken", "these tests include comparison tests

6-n- propylthiouracil is an intensely bitter compound that is only detected by some people", "to others, it is tasteless", "because of the variability, the brewer must be well versed in statistical analysis, especially in the field of bias", " standard sensory analyses include the following evaluative tests", "each is further  described in this section below:  \u2022 paired comparison test;

affect the flavor of the beer", "it is performed by a giving the tester an array of 18 samples in six columns", "each column of the array contains two identical control samples that have not been modified", "the third sample in each column is the adulterated sample", "the amount of the additive is increased from left to right", "the tester is then asked to identify which of the three samples
