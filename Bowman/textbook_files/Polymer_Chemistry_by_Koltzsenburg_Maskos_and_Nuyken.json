comparatively new field", "the  empirical use of polymeric materials made from natural substances has been documented  for centuries; however, only the pioneering work of the late hermann staudinger (1926),  a nobel laureate, in the 1920s provided the basis for a systematic understanding of this  class of materials", "in the decades since then, polymer science has developed to become  both technically demanding and industrially extremely important", "in particular, polymer  science is characterized by its interdisciplinary nature:  5 most technologically relevant macromolecules1 are based on a carbon backbone and   thus belong in the realm of organic chemistry", "  5 approximately  half  of  all  polymers  produced  today  are  synthesized  using  organo-   metallic catalysts", "  5 a description of the behavior of both solid polymers and their solutions is now based   on well-established physical and physicochemical theories", "  5 because macromolecules are often used in the area of classical materials, processing  and molding of polymers is an essential step in the production of finished products", " thus, engineering science is also important", "in medical technologies, polymers are used  in  highly  specialized  applications,  such  as  artificial  heart  valves,  eye  lenses,  or  as  materials for medical devices", " last but not least, as well as the vast and significant use of synthetic polymers, macro- molecules are of crucial biological importance", "undoubtedly the most important polymer  in the world-without which human existence would not be possible-is dna", "without its  polymeric nature, dna could not fulfill its essential role as the memory molecule of living  systems", "if the molecules were not linked to a polymeric strand, dna would be nothing  more than a mixture of four different bases with no defined structure and therefore without  biological function", "in addition to the millions of tons of natural rubber processed annu- ally, further examples of biopolymers essential to life include proteins that catalyze chemi- cal  reactions  as  enzymes,  form  membranes,  or  act  as  antibodies  differentiating  between  friend and foe", " this  chapter  deals  with  the  basic  concepts  and  definitions  of  polymer  science  and  especially the most important question that a natural scientist can ask: \u201cwhy?\u201d in particu- lar, why should one take an interest in this field? it is shown that polymers constitute a  class of materials that not only make an essential contribution to the existence of life in the  form of biological macromolecules, but without which, thanks to their myriad technical  applications, our modern daily life would be no longer conceivable", " 1.1    polymers: unique materials  even if we restrict ourselves to the field of non-biogenic, traditional materials, macro- molecules are a material class of unparalleled versatility", "however, the range of properties  covered by polymeric materials is much broader than that of traditional materials", "thus,  for example:  1  originally, a distinction was made between macromolecular substances and polymers", "this differentiation   has become unnecessary", "in this book, these terms are used congruently", "  1.1 \u00b7 polymers: unique materials  3  1   5 glass fiber reinforced plastics can have tensile strengths that rival, e.g., steel, whereas  other polymers such as polyurethane foams can be used as soft cushions or mattresses", " 5 most plastics are electrical insulators, but highly conjugated polymers have also been  synthesized with specific conductivities of the same order of magnitude of those of  highly conductive metals (naarmann and theophilou 1987)", "  5 the density of porous polymeric materials can be varied across a very wide range", "in  particular, from polymer foams such as styrofoam\u00ae, extremely lightweight articles can  be produced.2   5 the  melting  point  of  polymers  can  also  be  greatly  modified  by  varying  the  macromolecular  architecture", " some  polymers  can  be  physically  described  as  highly  viscous melts even at room temperature, whereas other polymers have melting points  of several hundred degrees celsius, and can be heated to red heat or sintered", "of course,  the temperature range of the melting or softening point is critical for the temperature at  which  a  material  can  be  used  or  processed", " on  the  one  hand,  a  high  melting  point  allows a high service temperature but requires a lot of energy to process the molten  material into the final shape", "for many materials in everyday life, which are only used  at room temperature, a low melting point is an advantage because they can be processed  much more resource-efficiently than materials with a high melting point", "here, too, the  unrivaled variability that polymers offer is often a decisive and advantageous factor", " because of their great versatility and their resulting unique material properties, syn- thetic polymeric materials have become indispensable in our daily lives", "many familiar  applications can only be realized using macromolecular materials:  5 the electrical and electronics industries in their current form are difficult to envisage  without polymers", "this statement includes seemingly trivial applications such as the  sheathing  for  electric  cables-no  other  non-polymeric  substance  class  provides  materials that are both flexible and at the same time act as electrical insulators", "even in  technically much more demanding applications, such as the manufacture of solar cells,  leds, or integrated microchips, polymers play a crucial role, e.g., as etching masks,  protective coatings, dielectrics, or fiber optics", "  5 the  modern  automobile  would  also  be  unthinkable  without  polymers", " all  motor  vehicles manufactured today are covered with a polymer layer-the so-called clearcoat", " in addition, polymers, from which, for example, the tires, dashboard, seat cushions,  and bumpers are constructed, make a major contribution to reducing the weight of the  vehicle, thus limiting the fuel consumption", "  5 the construction industry has also benefited enormously from this relatively young  class  of  materials", " polymers  in  the  form  of  insulating  foams  reduce  the  energy  consumption  of  buildings,  serve  as  conduits  for  water  supply  and  sanitation,  and  provide a weather-resistant alternative to the use of exterior wood", "  5 as  packaging,  polymers  are  now  irreplaceable,  especially  for  food  packaging  or  as   shock absorbing material for goods in transit", " polymers find applications not just as classical materials but also as, mostly soluble,  active  ingredients  and  functional  additives", " as  such,  they  often  go  unnoticed  because   2   low-density materials such as metal foams or ceramic aerosols can also be produced from non-polymeric  materials; these, however, do not have the same breadth of application in everyday life as polymers", "  4     chapter 1 \u00b7 introduction and basic concepts  1

pharmaceutical products", "they are also used in water treatment and paper  production", "in the latter capacity, macromolecules as functional polymers are discussed  in detail in 7 chap", "19", " 1.2    definition of terminology and basic concepts  in the following section a brief introduction to the basic concepts of polymer science is  given", " 1.2.1    fundamentals  the term  polymer refers by definition to molecules formed from a number of building  blocks, called monomers, usually connected by covalent bonds", "the prefix \u201cpoly\u201d comes  from the greek word for \u201cmany\u201d whereas the greek prefix \u201cmono\u201d means \u201csingle\u201d and  refers  here  to  a  single  block", " in  the  synthesis  of  many  polymers,  monomers  are  linked  together in the same manner to form a single chain consisting of covalently connected  repeating units (", "see fig", "1.1)", " there  is  no  definitive  limit  on  the  number  of  repeating  units  required  to  meet  the  definition of the polymer", "in general, it is stipulated that the number n, also referred to as  the degree of polymerization, must be sufficiently high that the physicochemical properties  of the resulting molecule no longer change significantly with each addition of a further  repeating unit", "this definition is not exact", "macromolecules that are composed of rela- tively few repeating units do not meet this definition and the term oligomers (\u201coligo\u201d = \u201cfew\u201d)  is used for such molecules", " one example of a polymerization reaction is the reaction of ethene to form polyethyl- ene (", "see fig", "1.2)", "in this reaction, the c=c double bond of the ethylene is converted into  a single bond", " from the definition of the term polymer, it follows that in principle any chemical mol- ecule that can form two (or more) bonds can be used as a monomer for the synthesis of  macromolecules", "this allows a huge variety of accessible structures which barely set a limit  to the imagination of the synthetic chemist", "  ", "fig", "1.1  schematic  structure of a polymer of n  repeating units  n  n   ", "fig", "1.2  polymerization of  ethene to polyethylene

"for the control of these properties, a huge array of  adjustments is available to the polymer chemist", "the most important are:  5 type of monomers  5 the chemical bond between the repeating units-for example, ether vs amide bonds  5 degree of polymerization  5 architecture of the chain-for example, linear or cross-linked  5 incorporation  of  chemically  different  monomers  along  the  polymer  chains   (copolymerization)   5 sequence  of  monomers  in  a  copolymerization-for  example,  alternately  or  in  long   sequences which consist of only one type of monomer (7 see sect", "1.3.3)   5 specific  interactions  between  the  components  of  the  polymer  chain,  e.g.,  hydrogen   bonding or dipole-dipole interactions  in addition to these essential questions, many other factors, such as admixtures (addi- tives)  and  material  processing,  also  have  an  influence  on  the  properties  of  macromole- cules", "the  aim  of  this  book  is  to  provide,  against  the  background  of  an  almost  infinite  variety of possible polymer structures, an overview of the essential principles that can be  used for the selective synthesis of structures with desired properties", " 1.2.2    polyreactions  in the following, a brief overview of the basic possibilities for the synthesis of polymers  (polyreactions) is given", "these can be classified according to various criteria", " depending on the manner in which the polymer chains are constructed in the course  of the polyreaction of the monomers, a distinction can be made between step-growth and  chain-growth reactions", "  step-growth reactions this polymerization process can, in principle, be applied to all organic compounds which  have two functional groups capable of forming a chemical bond", "classic examples of this  are ester, amide, or urethane bonds (", "see fig", "1.3)", " the  resulting  polymers  here  are  referred  to  as  polyesters,  polyamides,  or  polyure-  thanes", "details on the nomenclature can be found in 7 sect", "1.2.3", "  chain-growth reactions in chain-growth reactions, the polymerization can ensue by an addition to a polymeriz- able group, especially an olefinic double bond, or by the opening of a ring", "the essential  criterion for chain growth is the existence of a (usually high energy and unstable) active  particle, which is able to add to a monomer unit and thereby transfers its active character  to the newly incorporated repeating unit", "this leads-as with a falling row of dominoes- to a chain reaction in which the growing chain continuously adds additional monomer  units until no more monomer is available or side reactions occur", " vinyl compounds can often be polymerized by a chain-growth mechanism", "here, the  double bond is converted into two single bonds (", "see fig", "1.4)", "because, in the case of car- bon, two single bonds have less enthalpy than one double bond, the reaction is exothermic", "  6

oxide (oxirane), undergo facile polymerization", " as with small molecule organic chemistry, chain-growth reactions are classified accord- ing to whether they involve radical, positively, or negatively charged reactive species", "in these  cases,  one  refers  to  a  radical,  cationic,  or  anionic  polymerization,  respectively", " another  important class of chain-growth

1  the latter differentiation makes a stringent subdivision of the different types of polym- erizations  difficult,  in  particular  in  the  field  of  chain  reactions", " thus,  for  example,   ring- opening polymerization is possible by both catalytic and ionic mechanisms", "likewise,  they  can  occur  both  via  step-growth  reactions  and  chain-growth  reactions", " however,  there is little value in making this distinction between polycondensation and polyaddition  and this is not being pursued further here", " this difficulty has been accounted for in this book by the inclusion of a separate chap- ter on ring-opening polymerization (7 see chap", "12), and the basic mechanisms are dis- cussed in the preceding chapters", " a  detailed  overview  of  methods  for  synthesizing  macromolecules  can  be  found  in   7 chaps", "8-12", " 1.2.3    nomenclature of polymers  the basic principle of polymer nomenclature rests on the designation of the monomer or  repeating  unit  set  in  brackets,  in  conjunction  with  the  prefix  \u201cpoly.\u201d  for  example,  poly(styrene) is produced from styrene", "whether one uses the name of the monomer or  the repeating unit is rather arbitrary", "thus, for example, the polymerization product of  styrene is mostly referred to as poly(styrene), whereas that of ethene, after the repeating  unit, usually as poly(ethylene)", "for reasons of clarity, the brackets are generally omitted  with polymers that consist only of a single monomer type (so-called homopolymers), and  are only used with copolymers, i.e., polymers composed of at least two chemically different  monomers (7 see sect", "1.3.3)", " in the formula, the repeating unit is placed in square brackets (", "see fig", "1.6)", "for more  complex structures it has also become common practice to indicate with dotted lines that  the molecule is further extended (", "see fig", "1.9)", " if  the  repeating  unit  is  further  altered  after  polymerization  by  a  chemical  reaction   (7 see chap", "15), the resulting polymer is often designated according to a formal mono- mer, but one that was not used in the polymerization", "for example, the product of hydro- lysis of polyvinyl acetate is referred to as polyvinyl alcohol, even though it is not accessible  via the direct polymerization of the (unstable) vinyl alcohol (", "see fig", "1.7)", "  ",

to plastic packaging", "such demands, however, often ignore the follow- ing considerations:  5 the transport from production to point of consumption", "for example, the transport  of a 150-g portion of yoghurt requires the transport of 85 g of packaging material if  the packaging is made of glass with an aluminum lid compared with ca", "5.5 g for the  corresponding plastic package", "this increases enormously the energy consumption   of transportation in a refrigerated vehicle", "the proportion of packaging for a plastic  yoghurt container is 3.5 % in contrast to 36.2 % for glass

evident that  this is not beneficial for the environment", "  5 as has already been mentioned, reusable packaging, especially in the foodstuff  sector, must be cleaned exceptionally thoroughly, which in turn consumes  energy which could just as well be used for the production of new packaging", " furthermore, a significant amount of the cleaning agents ends up in the  environment", " with this in mind, it is clear that the careful use of polymers can save significantly  more energy than is necessary for their production", "even in uses for which this is not the  case,  the  use  of  polymeric

definition macromolecules that are pro- duced from renewable raw material sourced from nature", "biogenic polymers such as cel- lulose  or  chitin,  which  can  be  directly  isolated  from  renewable

natural degree of polymerization is reduced to meet the spec- ifications of the particular application by hydrolysis", "starch with a low degree of polymer- ization is also referred to as maltodextrin", "complete hydrolysis of starch leads to d-glucose,  which can be further processed into other bio-based substances, such as bioethanol", " starch is almost exclusively obtained from plant sources where it is part of the energy   storage and is usually present in the form of fine granules", " naturally occurring starch is generally a mixture of amylose and amylopectin", "the dif- ference between these two starch isomers is that amylopectin chains are highly branched  whereas amylose chains are, largely, linear", "the ratio of amylose to amylopectin depends  to a large extent on the plant from which the starch has been obtained", "industrially, starch  is mainly produced from potatoes, rice, cereals, and cassava", " similar to gelatine, starch is widely used in the food industry, and is an essential com- ponent of noodles, flour, bread, and other baked goods", "in addition, starch is also used in  the paper industry as a binding or coating agent and in the pharmaceutical industry as an  ingredient in pills, for example, as a filler, disintegrant, or binding agent (7 sect", "19.6)", " thus, the main applications of starch, as is the case for gelatine, are different from the  classical uses of synthetic materials", "from a technical point of view, its especially strong  tendency  to  absorb  water  has  proven  to  be  a  big  problem;  the  absorption  of  water  has  considerable  influence  on  the  melting  and  glass  transition  temperatures  and  on  the    21.4 \u00b7 biopolymers  545  21   moduli", "thus the material properties and the temperature range in which the product can  be used are dependent on its water content", "the use of starch as a molded part is therefore  limited to relatively undemanding applications such as loose filler materials for the pack- aging of sensitive goods", "however, even this use is decreasing", "custom-fit molded parts  made  of  polystyrene  or  polyethylene  foam  are  becoming  more  popular", " blends  can  be  made from starch with other polymers, for instance, biodegradable synthetic polymers,  which are less prone to absorbing water and are thus more stable and whose properties are  less affected by the material\u2019s history", " in addition to these two major polysaccharide representatives, a large number of other  structures such as guar (e-412), xanthan (e-415), and alginate can also occur naturally", " many of these polysaccharides are used as thickeners, for example, in cosmetics, but also  in the crude oil industry", "a comprehensive discussion of the extraordinarily diverse range  of polysaccharides would, however, go beyond the scope of this book", "for further infor- mation  the  interested  reader  is  referred  to  the  specialist

polyamides)  5 polyols (e.g., for polyurethanes)  the properties of the polymers obtained are not dependent on whether the building  blocks are derived from renewable or fossil raw materials (as long

dioxide is produced", "examples of anaerobic environments are deep water and  rubbish tips", "anaerobic decomposition can also be used technologically to obtain biogas  from biomass", " the microorganisms responsible for degradation have to be able to absorb the organic  molecules and to metabolize them in their cells in order to be able to use them as a source  of food", "to facilitate this, two processes outside the microbial cell are necessary", " as a prerequisite, the polymer to be degraded must contain flexible structural units", " in particular, any crystalline domains must be dissolved; this step is of course unneces- sary  for  amorphous  polymers  or  for  the  amorphous  domains  of  partially  crystalline  materials", " the  flexible  chain  segments  must  be  chemically  split  into  smaller  molecules", " microorganisms secrete so-called extracellular enzymes that can split the polymer chains,  often via hydrolysis", "for this to take place, the chains have to be flexible enough to be able  to penetrate the catalytic center of the enzyme", "the fragments formed have to be water- soluble and able to pass through the cell walls or membranes of the microorganisms", "after  being taken up by the microorganism the fragmented parts are metabolized", " not all polymer chains can be split enzymatically", "in particular, polymers with simple,  saturated  hydrocarbon  backbones  are  deemed  to  be  either  not  very  degradable  or  not  degradable at all", "an exception is polyvinyl alcohol", " temperature, humidity, and oxygen content of the medium have a significant influ- ence on the biological degradation", "of course, as well as the microbiological degradation  pathways described here, thermal or photochemical degradation mechanisms mentioned  in 7 chap", "15 also play a part in the degradation of polymers in the environment", " to establish whether a given polymer is biodegradable or not, there are different, partly  national, standards", "the most important is the european standard en 13432, the american  astm d 6400-04, and the japanese greenpla", "all of these standards define basic require- ments for packaging materials which can decompose in industrial composting plants and  are thus compostable", "the most important test of aerobic degradability is the so-called  controlled composting test according to

provide a good  proportion of the energy required in the paper manufacturing process because of its sub- stantial  fuel value", "some paper manufacturing companies  (so-called paper mills) cover  80-100 % of their energy needs by burning lignin", "lignin is not by any means the primary  product of a paper mill, but it is certainly not a valueless waste product as often suggested  furthermore,

crustaceans can,  depending on the quality of the starting material, be converted into chitosan (by deacety- lation) and then used in winemaking (fining agent), agriculture (pesticide), or in the phar- maceutical industry, but this is a complex and expensive process and, to date, chitosan is  10-20 times more expensive than other synthetic alternatives", "nevertheless, both these  materials are currently the subject of considerable research", " in the last few years, it has become increasingly clear that the massive use of agricul- tural land for the production of chemical raw materials, such as bioethanol made from  maize or sugar cane, has meant that the following problem has occurred", "the amount of  agriculturally useful land available worldwide is decreasing because of climate change and  increasing soil erosion", "at the same time, the world population is continuously increasing", " furthermore,  the  demand  for  high  value  foodstuffs,  such  as  meat,  whose  production  requires a particularly large area of arable land, is also increasing.3 this means that, mid-  and long term, it will become even more difficult than it already is to meet the nutritional  needs of the world\u2019s population", "against this background, the use of arable land for the  production  of  raw  materials  rather  than  food  is  controversial", " the  area  of  arable  land  needed to replace conventional polymers with polymers based on renewable raw materi- als to a significant extent is therefore not going to be available in the foreseeable future", " the use of renewable resources for the production of plastics or other chemicals therefore  has to be restricted to sources of raw materials not useful to humans either as food or for  other purposes", "examples of such raw materials are wood waste or plants with low nutri- tional value which thrive in soil or areas where the production of high quality crops is not  possible", "the progress mentioned at the
